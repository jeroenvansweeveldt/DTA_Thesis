GOTHENBURG 23 MAY 1671

Your letters of the r4th, 21st and 25th last have reached me safely, from which I have learned
that you have sold and delivered the 997 bars of voyage-iron which I sent with Hans
Michelsen. I have received the sale account, examined it, found it correct and debited you
with the net proceeds of £188 8s 3d stg. which you mentioned in your letter, without
prejudice. As you know perfectly well, the 3 per cent which you charge me relates to the sale
of iron and to the remittance of bills of exchange as well, as was agreed with the late Mr
Marescoe. You have undertaken to continue on the same conditions which you have
confirmed in several letters, though I can quite believe that you did so precipitately. You will
have debited the £4 115 od for the 20 bars which Anders Beursen delivered short, although
since I have received some information from the Crown galley I expect to be able to make
good some of it.

Ihave credited you with 30s for the blue waistcoat. I have received 150 slb of iron out of
Varmland, but as it is of only ordinary quality I have not wanted to send it but thought of
using it as ballast in our ships and sending it to Portugal where it can make RD 8 per slb. Pitch
has fallen into diverse hands here and is exported to [England] by various people and then
undersold. I have spoken to several and told them that a friend of mine wanted to lay out
some money, but what can I say, seeing that there are various ‘cladders’ here who also want to
do so. The same thing is beginning to happen with iron. There are some who, for cash down,
are selling at 8 or even 12s liib. per slb below the ordinary price. It is also falling in price in
Hamburg. If I can get it to Portugal before these others there might be no great loss—time
will tell.

It is a good thing that the new duties in [England] on iron and other wares will not
commence this year. The King here has also been thinking of raising the duty by 16 stuivers
per slb, though so far it has not been done, but some small ships have had their exemption
taken away and must now pay 8 stuivers more per slb, though the King has been petitioned
about it. If any changes should occur we shall learn in due course.

Thave obtained acceptance of the £100 remitted to Bex at Rotterdam at 36s 1g and today I
got news from the widow of Libert Wolters that you had remitted her £188 for my account
in two bills at 35s 3g, for which acceptance has been procured. I shall be glad to learn soon
from Mr Bex what remains to be remitted to Amsterdam.

Anders Beursen arrived here over three weeks ago without delivering to me the basket
with 24 bottles of Spanish Canary. Before your letter of the 21st of April came the basket was
delivered to someone else who thought that Jan Kreuger had sent it to him, and the customs
official and some others have enjoyed some of the bottles. Nevertheless you have my thanks,
seeing that there is no other way of demonstrating my gratitude from this country-town.
Wherewith, my regards, &e.
