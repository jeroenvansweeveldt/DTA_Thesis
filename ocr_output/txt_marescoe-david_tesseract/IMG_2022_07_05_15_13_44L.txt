Since my departure from Stockholm about a fortnight ago I have found here several of your
letters, some written in partnership as well as individually. However, I have seen, not without
great shock and astonishment, that you have neither honoured my drafts nor Mr Beck’s,
which is in direct contradiction of your own letter in which you wrote that you would not
satisfy the £1,700 to Mr Neltorp? but that I could expect to draw £1,000 on you at 2, 4 and
6 months time. I have now followed your instructions and given orders to Mr Beck in
Hamburg to draw that much on you. Now comes your latest letter, refusing payment! As I
wrote to you, with my resources otherwise disposed I really do not know how I am to
interpret this, and I cannot guess what you intend by it. I certainly intend to have control over
things myself, so I must ask you, in the friendliest way, to let me know at once how much of
my resources are disposed of and to whom, so that I can have a balanced account. I must tell
you, truthfully, I do not know where I am, standing here between two fires. I proceeded on
the basis of your letters and arranged my plans accordingly, but—God help me—find myself
mistaken, so that Iam thrown off my bearings.? You have truly done me a great wrong by
this, for which I must appeal to God. I beg you, just let me know how my assets have been
disposed of and whether they can be recovered. Whether or not you have paid others without
orders you will know best; I do not know, because I employed you as my agent. When, for
the first time, you would not pay the money to Mr Neltorp it was much the same as
protesting the bill of exchange, and after that you gave me instructions to draw up to £1,000
on you, which I did, and gave you no other orders except to satisfy Mr Beck. If you have paid
