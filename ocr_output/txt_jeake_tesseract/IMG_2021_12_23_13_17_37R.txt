IN OBITUM VERE
Deploratum Samuelis Jeake, Gent. (qui Obijt 22 Novembris, 1699) Carmen

Lugubre.

Go mournful Muse! In sable Dress appear,
Th’Occasions sad, the Loss too great to baer;
Too great for Words: Let then our tender Eyes
Express the rest in Liquid Elegies.

Could’st thou alone in gen’ral Terms relate

Of transitory Things the common Fate;

Tell us how Scepters break and Crowns do fall,

How time first shakes and after throws down all;
How that fair lump of animated Clay

Which seems to thrive in Health and Strength to Day,
To Morrow’s broke, enclosed in its Urn,

And to its native Dust will soone return;

How the gay Tapour which appears so bright,
Burning with Vigour is extinguish’d quite

By sudden Blasts, and never holds till Night;

How Death, the cunning Marksman, strikes the best
Of Vertues Favourites and spares the rest:

Could’st thou but cease, and give no nearer touch,
We should not be affected half so much,

But Ah! The tydings of so dear a Friend

Dear by Desert, who did so far transcend

The vulgar Sort, crop’t off in blooming Years

By fatal Stroke, claims our unmeasur’d Tears;

So small, so just a Tribute let us pay:

Where Love Commands the Passions must obey.
Had we the Gums or Spice our famous Isle
Yearly receives from Rich Arabia’s Soil

Instately Ships, where Silver Thames doth fall,
To his Embalming wee’d devote them all.

Great Blessings whilst enjoy’d too common seem,
But when remov’d they raise our just Esteem:
