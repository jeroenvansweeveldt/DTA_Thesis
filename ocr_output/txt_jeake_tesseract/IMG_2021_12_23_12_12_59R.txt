Lond May the 19"
Dear Sonne

health. Capt Eve was at my Cusen Whitmans I thinke about Munday was
aloan Mr Whitman would have come for me but he pretended hast saayd he
would come agane a Thursday where I sat to expect him but he hath not been
there since. 1 am never like to end my Business with Mr Goodenough I sup-
pose he meanes to shew som trick Sir Thomas Player told Mr Firman he
could have had forty pound but he did not except it & now cannot hear fur-
ther. Mr Goodenough was not to be spoke with. Some did suppose the riot
might be the cause some say he is not worth six pence but I rather fear he
desigens to get more money of me though Mr Firmen told me they did not
charge Nat with any wronge he had done his Master of money but that there
was some small matter due to nat upon account. I have lost Nat againe can-
not learne what is become of him. I am tired out of my life & my troubles
doth discompose me. I was forced to my bed yesterday all day to be tired I
would not undergoe soe much as I have done for a hundred pound twill cer-
tainly kill me I shall never se poore Betty again I feare tis not probable I can
possible recover to goe through this trouble I am tumbled from post to pillar
& nobody regards my busines wither was I willing to undertake it knowing
my owne insufficience to performe it but hear I am afflicted tormented with-
out any relief. I received this day of Mr Mun eight pound upon Mr Millers
account pray paye him tell Betty a sute of riban will cost ten shilling, the
girdles are mostly tied before your Good father is well & we all remember our

kind loves & to all friends. I am Dear sonne yr loving Mother Barbara
Hartshorne.
