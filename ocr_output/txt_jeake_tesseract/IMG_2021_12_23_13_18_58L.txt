Yours Dear Mother I received am sorry to hear you are so much alone. I hope
ina short time I shall have the satisfaction of seeing you and my Dear Children
Mr Benge has given Mr Miller a Bill for £200 which he has received this day
so there is now some hopes there will be an end of that tedious business. For
your money when I come home will give you an account what I have done the
business will be free for you still if you approve it tis not in the govenment. I
wish the Bride joy now she has left me she is out of fear of my leaving of her
Bettys journey is an unimpeded frolick. I am sorry to hear Sarah makes out
so badly I hope when return to quicken her or get another. Marys Mrs is not
brought to bed as I hear she thinks the time long as Mary can do I add no
more but humble Duty to your Dear Self with Love to my children and
service to my friends I am
