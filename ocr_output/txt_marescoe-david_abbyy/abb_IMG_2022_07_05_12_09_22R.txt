Markets and Merchants of the Late Seventeenth Century	237
   I have loaded for my account in the Deensche Pheenix, which will be ready in a few day'-
      Sib. 884.12 various sorts of fine bar-iron;
      Sib. 263.6	rod-iron;
      106 casks of steel in tall casks;
      52 ditto in flat casks;
      83I dozen long deals, to complete the cargo,
all of which is consigned to you. The bill of lading will be sent with my next letter, and when the ship arrives in [London] I beg you to unload it as soon as possible and speed it on its way to St Ubes in ballast as it has also been chartered by Mr Potter as usual so that it can complete its journey before the winter. Please help the captain, who is Claus Willman, in every way, and we will be most grateful.
   I have ordered these goods, as well as those in the schuit, St Peter to be insured by Peter Simons in Amsterdam. I hope to God the premium will be justified. Since I have charged him with some bills of exchange which arc going to fall due soon, I have written to tell him to correspond with you and to draw on you for my account; and if some misfortune should overtake the goods (which God forbid!) you could draw on him in return as he will have had them insured. And I would like you to allow Mr Simons to draw on you nine or ten thousand rixdollars. Please accommodate him. The interest on what you advance will be made good, and I shall shortly be sending you more goods of which you will be advised.
   Your letters of the 15th and 22nd of May to my brother Jacob have been received in his absence, and—following his instructions—1 have opened them and read their contents. I am delighted to see that Capt. Erick Erickson has arrived. God be thanked for his blessings! As to the money you have advanced on his goods—he will gladly make it good, regarding j per cent per month interest as cheap. It is good that you have told Mr Hicbenaer that he may draw on you up to 8,000 RD, and if it docs not inconvenience you, you could, according to your offer, remit the remainder to Messrs Van Baerle as it is more profitable for my brother. He will make good the interest on what you advance.
  However, I am not happy to see that the price of copper-wire is so low, and I hope it will improve. Here copper prices are rising as the copper mine is producing little because of some roof-falls which have occurred. I shall inform my brother of what you write about the various sorts of wire, and I shall be glad to learn to whom the 1,650 coils of wire from Cock3 have come. As for my brother’s affairs, I hope he will have returned home in a month or six weeks time. Your enclosure to Mr Hcgcrsticrn4 came to me under the cover of Mr Caspar Bruyn’s and was accidentally opened in the presence of two good friends. Nothing in it was read, but it was sealed up again and sent to his house where he opened it and then sealed it again and returns it to you again. In future, please do not. send him any letters under cover to me or Mr Bruyn. Wherewith, regards, &c.
