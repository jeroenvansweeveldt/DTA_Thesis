| D] Your letters of the 14th, 21st and 25th last have reached me safely, from which I have learned
that you have sold and delivered the 997 bars of voyage-iron which I sent with Hans
Michelson. I have received the sale account, examined it, found it correct and debited you
with the net proceeds of £188 8s 3d stg. which you mentioned in your letter, without
prejudice. As you know perfectly well, the 3 per cent which you charge me relates to the sale
of iron and to the remittance of bills of exchange as well, as was agreed with the late Mr
Marcscoe. You have undertaken to continue on the same conditions which you have
confirmed in several letters, though I can quite believe that you did so precipitately. You will
have debited the .£4 1 is od for the 20 bars which Anders Bcurscn delivered short, although
since I have received some information from the Crown galley I expect to be able to make
good some of it.
   I have credited you with 30s for the blue waistcoat. I have received 150 sib of iron out of
Viirmland, but as it is of only ordinary quality I have not wanted to send it but thought of
using it as ballast in our ships and sending it to Portugal where it can make R.D 8 per sib. Pitch
has fallen into diverse hands here and is exported to [England] by various people and then
undersold. I have spoken to several and told them that a friend of mine wanted to lay out
some money, but what can I say, seeing that there arc various ‘claddcrs’ here who also want tc
do so. The same thing is beginning to happen with iron. There arc some who, for cash down
arc selling at 8 or even 12s liib. per sib below the ordinary price. It is also falling in price ii.
Hamburg. If I can get it to Portugal before these others there might be no great loss—time
will tell.
   It is a good thing that the new duties in [England] on iron and other wares will not
commence this year. The King here has also been thinking of raising the duty by 16 stuivers
per sib, though so far it has not been done, but some small ships have had their exemption
taken away and must now pay 8 stuivers more per sib, though the King has been petitioned
about it. If any changes should occur we shall learn in due course.
   I have obtained acceptance of the £ 100 remitted to Bex at Rotterdam at 365 and today I
got news from the widow of Libert Wolters that you had remitted her £ 188 for my account
in two bills at 35s 3^, for which acceptance has been procured. I shall be glad to learn soon
from Mr Bex what remains to be remitted to Amsterdam.
   Anders Bcurscn arrived here over three weeks ago without delivering to me the basket
with 24 bottles of Spanish Canary. Before your letter of the 21st of April came the basket was
delivered to someone else who thought that Jan Krcugcr had sent it to him, and the customs
official and some others have enjoyed some of the bottles. Nevertheless you have my thanks,
seeing that there is no other way of demonstrating my gratitude from this country-town.
Wherewith, my regards, &c.
