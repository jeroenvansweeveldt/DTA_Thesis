[D] Since my departure from Stockholm about a fortnight ago I have found here several of your letters, some written in partnership as well as individually. However, I have seen, not without great shock and astonishment, that you have neither honoured my drafts nor Mr Beck’s, which is in direct contradiction of your own letter in which you wrote that you would not satisfy the £1,700 to Mr Neltorp1 but that I could expect to draw £1,000 on you at 2, 4 and 6 months time.

As I wrote to you, with my resources otherwise disposed I really do not know how I am to interpret this, and I cannot guess what you intend by it. I certainly intend to have control over things myself, so I must ask you, in the friendliest way, to let me know at once how much of my resources arc disposed of and to whom, so that I can have a balanced account. I must tell you, truthfully, I do not know where I am, standing here between two fires. I proceeded on the basis of your letters and arranged my plans accordingly, but—God help me-—find myself mistaken, so that I am thrown off my bearings.2 You have truly done me a great wrong by this, for which I must appeal to God. I beg you, just let me know how my assets have been disposed of and whether they can be recovered. Whether or not you have paid others without orders you will know best; I do not know, because I employed you as my agent. When, for the first time, you would not pay the money to Mr Neltorp it was much the same as protesting the bill of exchange, and after that you gave me instructions to draw up to £ 1,000 on you, which I did, and gave you no other orders except to satisfy Mr Beck. If you have paid
