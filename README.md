# DTA_Thesis
Repository for the MA Digital Text Analysis thesis

This repository is currently under reconstruction - due to a serious injury from which I had to recover over the course of several months, my promotor did some of the work in constructing the final corpora from the annotated logical layout analysis files. I am currently replicating the workflow. Concretely, other than restructuring the repository into something more uniform and user-friendly, what will be added is this:

+ Scripts for generated Jeake and Marescoe-David .json corpora.
+ Analysis of Tesseract's ocr-output quality.
