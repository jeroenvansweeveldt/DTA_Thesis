It is now .22. weekes ago she finished her course, she sickened first like an Ague, upon the 29\" of October being Tuesday, on the wednesday she went out to Goodman Millers to repetition, the thursday the fit tooke her againe & held her as before, & on the friday she went out to a buriall which was the last time she was forth. On the Saterday she was tooke againe & so it held her all night & the next day being Sabbath she was very sicke, yet in the Afternoone she rose, but still continuing sicke, on the Monday as she lay, she read the .102. Psalme,” for the Lord seemed to hide himselfe from her, but he did not forsake her over long, in that night hee revealed himselfe to her in a sweet manner, so that her bruised bones leapt for joy, in the morning she revealed to us what a sweet night she had enjoyed, & how the Lord had let out him selfe to her from these words of the .36. Psalme 5.6.7.8.9. verses” and that now she had found by experience what we have yet but by promise, that heaviness may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning. Continuing sicke we sought to the Physician, this weeke like a Saint, her words ministered grace to the hearers, & she was perswaded she should dye on the Sabbath & that having done a weekes work she should enter into his rest yet God otherwise prevented & that Satan might take his last farewell of troubling her tooke occasion hereby to molest her but at length the Lord revealed himselfe to her more fully then before, so that about the middle of the weeke she told us she was as full of joy as her heart could hold. The Lord had now afflicted her with a sore mouth, which much troubled her to speake, about the latter end of the weeke we had good hope of her recovery, but God ordered it better for her gaine though for our losse, on the saterday night & Sabbath following she could take downe nothing but beere & suger with a feather & on the monday & tuesday she waxing worse & worse, we had little hope of life left in her, on the Wednesday being the .20\". day of November about .4. a clocke in the afternoone she sweetly yielded up her soule into her Fathers hands, catching up her hands together uttered these words Come Lord but what more could not be heard. Thus as you had acquaintance of her in her life, you are acquainted with a true relation of her death, that you may rejoyce with her & weepe with me, & that God to whom alone belong the issues of life & death helpe us to glorifie him in either of both conditions.

The motive induceing my pen to scrible these few lines unto you is notoriouse and very urgent to any honest hart at the first riseing of this storme, I had well hoped a strong gale of patience would have blowen it over, and those whisperings thatt are now soe curant amongst you would have beene killed in the shell butt my patience can hold noe longer, and soe you have compelled me if any thing be nott to your compelatary motion thanke your selves and excuse him thatt dare nott now butt acuse you, least guilt of selfe violente should ly upon my selfe: neither have you stayed heare butt soe great Caracters have you written them in, thatt he that runs may read it: and I thatt had thought to have prest my pen for silent service must now stepp forth in a [word illegible] defence to releave my selfe againest your calumniations which now foloweth, I shall sume them up, they are the fo[llowing]\\n That I hold and mentione dangerouse erours, before ignorante people to deceive them, butt if it weare before my match I would be delte with well inough: (and they are these) as that Mr Harrison did well in praying for the woman falen into the scandalous sine of fornication, when shee sent her bill to the congregation also that I mentione thatt it was well done in him to use the word (deare sister) at the buriall of the Romane Catholique that I have medled with one of the cheefest of the Towne which I had best lett aloane, least it be worse for me then I am aware of.\\n That it is become a wonder unto you thatt I am sufered to be in the Towne and nott rather to live with my wife as a man of knowledge.\\n That you wonder thatt mother Renard will sufer me to use her house soe much and will nott reprove me for these things you have amongst you transferred that eternall ministeriall dignitie, atending your owne pastour: (and that unto me undiservedly) in these words (thatt I was more able in in gifts then Mr Harison wish my that he could pray as well as I can doe which I utterly disclaime, thus I have summed by the Cheefe [word illegible] me laine in a succinct way to give you some short answer.\\n For the first obiection I scorne to deceive the simple or to delude the ignorant by overpowering them with knowledg butt bring me before whome you please what ever I have said, I shall nott feare to justifie whatt I said; soe long as I have one drop of blood in my vaines: therefore you utter a dareing falacy againe indesence of Mr Harison praying for the woman I spoke whatt I thought on it, and now doe positively afirme it before whome you please, and to whome you will, that he did well in it and had comitted a great sinne if he had nott prayed for her, therefore I produce these scriptures read them your selfe, It is both commanded and practised as a duty in the word of God as a rule for us to walke by, it is commanded in Math: 5: 44,” Jer: 29: 7° soe it is practised by the people of God also 1 Sam: 12: 19\"\\' very pertinent to the purpose as will appeare if you examine these texts with a curious eie soe to this purpose is that of Steven, Acts 7: 60° these are [word illegible] for the [word illegible] of such a cleare truth as this is soe thatt I hope you will nott deny this seing it carieth maiesty from heaven with it, and I suppose I need nott be ashamed to mentaine the truth, nott onely before weake Christians, but also the strongest that are.\\n Also for his using the word (deare Sister) it was nott unlawfull as I conceive, for first she was a deare sister by creation, we had all one father by creation soe she was a sister, again she was a sister by profession, she professed Jesus Christ, and also she was a sister by Baptisme, sow (as I can prove) she was baptised into the church and as yet never cutt of by noe censure of the church therefore deare sister also she was deare in regard of the sufficiency of the meritt of Christs death that was ofered for the elect, and that unto salutation; for the wicked that soe he might judge them, as psalme 2: 8 verse aske of me and I shall give the the [sic] heathen for thy Inheritance and the out most parts of the earth and thou shalt bruse them with a rod of Iron soe much for that obiection.®\\n The secondeth foloweth I answer for my medleing with great ones, I feare Not to give an account when ever I am Called unto it I that know I may nott curse the king in my chamber, I that know the apostle recons it by far a grand imposture to speake evell of dignities, it weare grosse impietie in me to fall thus grosely, and if you lett me butt have the conceite of an hypocrite in your head, you may well know it is nott the way to gaine creditt to my selfe, butt ndeed I have alwayes beene soe wary of speaking evell of honest dignities that I dare nott entertaine the least irreverent thought and whatt sover our evell envieing Christians doe report, whose glory and practise it is to run prateing from house to house to heare and tell (as I by experience know some) yet what danger soever may come to me I pas nott, because if I doe suffer I canott sufer as a delinquent and lett me speake to you Samuell I hope you will nott believe it, but yet soe far am I from feareing whatt I have said or done that in stead of crying petavi, I rather say facere pesimus” but I hope I shall nott have cause to feare any such tryall I have done with this also. To the third particular I answer it is nott convenient for me to write the reason of my being absent from my wife neither would my sheete containe it yett as you are a Christian and as you are an unquestionable believer in my opinion, I hold my selfe bound to signifie to you thatt it is nott oute of any dislike each of other, we live apart: butt onely for some reasons which if you be curious to know when you and I meet I shall lay them downe to your satisfaction, I hope; and tell me Samuell what hurte have I done in your Towne sure I first know it speake plaine I have prayed for the peace and prosperity of it, whether they have beene answered or noe that must be (for the most of them both to you and me) counsell or at least a secrett not to be [word illegible] I have spent my time if it fell to my lot to doe good not onely to my selfe but others I have undergone many hot thunderbolts amongst you, troubles doe surround me dayly from abroad, and what out with day by contestings and a man of temptations which with sorow I am faine now to boast of unto you own of myne infirmities, and why you would have one sent out of the Towne I know nott I am sory thatt the saints are weary of me for wicked men it is noe nuse to heare there rebylenys both of you and me, and liveing and the dead butt you to be weary of me toucheth me verie much butt noe marvell sometimes I am a burthen to my selfe, and yet if you know any course or way to have me out spare nott however this I canott butt take as an affliction sent of God to weed out some hurt, oh that I may make a hapie use of it soe much for that. For the 4\" thing I have nott much to say to it, it is rather bent upon her (whoe as I have heard since I began this letter) hath beene the [word lost] of this storme, god grant I may make a hapie use of it soe I leave that and her too worse then I though to have done.\\n The last is something worse then the rest, for your comparsisons betweene Mr Harison and my selfe, that I was more able then he for discourse and prayer, I doe nott aprove of it butt doe protest in the presence of God I desire nott for to be accounted neither Doe I believe it to be true in part or in whole, whatt shall I say, I utterly disclaime it I say noe more onely dearely beloved had you seene these faults in me this tard was not the way to reclame me, in whispering behind my backe noe Samuell these rather stur up wrath and envy, and eyell surmises, butt our saviour layes downe another way 6 Gall 1** Math 18\" 15° which course if you take what [word illegible] my time, when you se me fall, lett me nott be [word illegible] then lett the righteous smite me thatt shall be good for me, soe shall nott my head be broken I shall make prayers for you, both now, and ever, while time lasts to me, or I to it and you eternised in the heavens.\\n \\nSoe praieth your unworthy friend\\n\\nJohn Coulton\\n\\nRey May 20\" 1641\\n\\nWhat ever from my pen doeth fall\\n\\nOh lord take thou the glory of all\\n\\nGoodman Coulton\\nI salute you, I perceive I am growne odious in your sight and become very obnoxious to you, by reason of some false accusations & calumnious aspersions cast on me by some that are seeming friends onely. I have now received your Letter, wherein you charge me with divers & severall false positions, at which I marvaile but I pray expect not such a circumspect answer as if I had learned the [words struck out] art to comprehend much matter in a few lines, or as if I had a helper to instruct & teach me, yet thinke not that it shall altogether die in silence when as for what I spoke I know how to answere if I goe awry teach me & I will learne, raise me to understand where in I have erred.\\n First you impute to me, that I should report you hold and maintaine langerous errors before ignorant people &tc. to notifie to you the words that then said in every particular as neere as I can remember (speaking the truth in Christ before whose dreadfull tribunall I must give accompt as of all my words & workes, so of this also whether they be good or evill) were these, that some of your Reasons to uphold praying for the Fornicator, & the words, Deare Sister, at the buriall of the Papist were very weake.\\n And now to insist a little larger on it, you would go about to prove it, you bring me scripture indeed, which as I conceive are nothing correspondent to the purpose, you quote me the precept of Christ & example of Steven, which instances onely praying for our enemies. I conceive there to be two sorts of enemies to be praied for & that after a double manner, the enemies of the Church of God in generall and our owne enemies in particular. For the first sort we are to pray either for their conversion (because we know not whether they belong to God or no) or confusion (as David imprecates in some of his Psalmes against such enemies) & this may be done in the publicke congregation. For our owne particular enemies, we may pray for them generally in the publicke congregation but not particularly, for if any have wronged abused or reviled us, so as it tends to the dishonour of God & scandall of his Gospell, though we are to forgive them in our heart & earnestly pray for their pardon & to qualifie our heat of malice with some affection of love: Yet not to testifie our forgiveness outwardly by praying for them publiquely till such time as they seeke reconciliation & submit themselves lest we confirme the verity of the former & insure the like upon our selves in future times. Now for your place in Jeremy 29.7.” where the prophet exhorts the people of the Jewes, to pray for the peace and prosperity of the city whether they were led captive producing this reason for in the peace of that, they shall have peace. Those words as I perceive are no proofe of the point in hand, when the prophets drift is to teach & divert the people how to undergoe their captivity with the more ease by praying that the city might be at peace freed from trouble & warre & perplexity, for they being there resident, if any such combustions be must be sure to share in them, therefore seeke the prosperity of the city & pray to the Lord for it, that so they might with the more patience & lesse grief waite upon God, for the time of their deliverance, not for any affection that the Prophet beareth to the Tyrant or to the City (which may seeme if you take the words too literally) noe for not onely the Israelites but all the world yea & the very insensible creatures should rejoyce when these Tyrants should be destroyed as we may read Isaiah .14. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. & so forward.* And for that in Samuel, unlesse you will prove the Israelites to be such as she is, is very impertinent, but if it were soe (which is a gross falsity to thinke,) yet its to no purpose for first its a question whether he praied for them in private or in publique, but if he did pray for them in publique, yet they first confess their sinnes & humble them selves openly before him, but you may tell me, so did she in regard she sent to be praied for, but it is apparent to the contrary whatever she seemingly pretends, witness her vile words spoken to one that professt Godlyness, about that time, which though she now deny yet can be justified on oath to the contrary, so that it is cleare she had no love nor liking to the waies of God, neither to humiliation nor prayer but onely to have her sickness removed (which many an honest woman endures more in the common disease of child bearing) it’s true we must judge charitably, but charity judges not absolutely not peremptorily & though it hope well of all things: yet it is not a toole to conclude all things. Again the prophet convicts them of & laies open unto them the hainousness of their sinne & reproves them sharpely & severely for it, & that before he prayes for or at the least manifests his prayer to them which may be plainly seene by viewing the context, which if she had beene (as the manner of some other reformed churches are) I could have held well with. But for to be praied for in the publique congregation before she had testified her humiliation & repentance & before she had beene soundly reproved, I cannot thinke to be lawfull since her fault was so scandalous, lest it were a countenancing of her in it. For the Apostle saith plaine .1.Tim. 5. 20.” them that sinne rebuke openly that the rest may feare, thus much for that.\\n Now for your Reasons to prove the words Deare Sister at the buriall of the Papist to be lawful, I thinke them little lesse than cavills, it’s true, we had all one father by creation, & we are all by nature the children of wrath, but now nature is changed by grace in the godly & old things are passed away, & we are now no more strangers & foreiners but citizens with the saints & houshold of God, and now what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness what communion hath light with darkness? What concord hath Christ with Belial? and what part hath a believer with an Infidell? I leave to the learned to judge.\\n And for her profession, I pray how did she professe Jesus Christ, was it not after a wrong manner? are not all the tenents of the papisticall religion for the most part egregious & pernicious errors, derogatory to the honour & dignity of Christ, and that in a high degree, I presume your selfe can witness, nay she was an Infidell being a papist, for they deny the faith of us Christians & cleave to the covenant of workes which is now abrogated, and no man 1s able to performe neither is any man justified by it. Gal. 3. 11.“° And as I said before what communion or fellowship hath a believer with them? And especially in such a neere bond of relation as to be a Sister or Brother to them by profession. I thinke it little lesse then to partake of their sinnes, wherein we lye lyable to partake of her plagues.\\n And for Baptisme, when she was baptized she knew not what she did, but others were surely for her, which when she came to age, was bound to performe, but refused (violating her covenant she there made & judged her selfe unworthy of eternall life, following dumbe Idolls as she was led) and joyned unto a false church: that the Apostles words might be verified they went out from us for they were not of us, if they had beene of us, they would no doubt have continued with us still. So that Antichristians & Christs followers have no relation nor affinity to or with one another. But you may object, it may be said to them as well as to carnall men living in this Church, I deny it, for they submitting themselves to the ordinances of God (though perhaps church papists) are under the compass of a truc visible church (as farre as I yet see) when as the Papists are of a false church &c. so much for that.\\n Secondly you blame me for saying you meddled with great ones which you had best let alone &c. I protest unto you, I never said it. The words that I said (as neere as I can remember without either addition or detraction) were these: you had discanted on some randome, concerning praying for Maudline, which if you have done, you know, whether they be great one or little ones, if you have not then you may repute me a lying Christian (as well as envying Christ) but I know on what grounds I spake it.\\n For your third it is partly true & partly false. I then spake in the words of the Apostle that you ought to live with your wife as a man of knowledge, which I thinke you cannot take distast at since it was the words of the Holy Ghost, & for your propounding to me the reasons of your living asunder, I desire it not. Thinke not (I pray) that I harbour curiosity so much in me, as to be a meddler in other folkes matters, lest I come under the Apostles reproofe, onely I thinke it occasion of scandall for a professor & his wife to live at variance. For the other part I disclaime it utterly & therefore cannot nor will not Answer for that which I never said nor thought.\\n For the fourth also is partly true & partly false, for the first I said it if I were to live in the house as Goody Kennard is I should not endure, but to reprove you plainly, which was all to my knowledge that I said, wherein I meant plainly & simply as I wish any one would do to me when they see amisse in me. But for the other that she should not suffer you to use her house, it is others slanders and not my words.\\n For your last I have nothing to do with it, neither did I know any word to that effect was spoke till I questioned about it & neither were as you have set them downe, but I wonder why you should burden me with it, seeing you know I spoke it not except by your denying the negative, you would have others prove the affirmative, which I know none meanes to doe. This I hope will give you satisfaction for that I spake, without any further contention, & whereas you reprove me for whispering behind your backe I may justly retort it on your selfe; for I spake it to one of your sociable companions, but you noised it abroad before divers as I had notice, before you knew the truth. Thus craving pardon for my boldness intreating you to make a favourable construction of all my Errors. I commit you to your safest conduct of the surest conductor and so remaine\\n \\nSometime your loved Sometime\\n\\nyour loathed\\n\\nSa: Jeake\\n',\n",

My tenderest Affections are toward you, whom I love as my owne soule, whose happines is my rejoycing, whose griefe is my Dollour, whose victories shall be my crowne, whose societies I judge my selfe unworthy to enjoy, because the Lord hath deprived me of it: & that I feare in anger. I am right glad to heare from you. Your letters did not a little refresh my dropping spirits. Oh how I long to see you! much more to abide with you; that so we have beene comely in our lives, in our deaths we might not have beene divided. & now what adds downe weight to my sorrowe? but that I feare I shall never see your faces more. But the will of the Lord must be done. I know mine iniquities are of such a distracting power that they do not onely sequester my friends but labour to separate my God from me. I have little to write to you, but a last farewell. I can do nothing for you but that which I daily do (to wit) often ply heaven with prayers for your good whose conditions all joyntly & every one severally according to my weake abillity both are & shall be commended to God continually by me. What shall I say? I desire your safe returne againe if the will of the Lord be so. I desire victory for you, against your & the Lords enemies. I desire you may (as I heare you are) be couragious, having so good a cause call & captaine. I desire you may keepe your selves from spiritual pollutions: Babes keepe yourselves from Idolls Amen.” And what you are deprived of in respect of publick Administrations, I desire the Lord by the immediate workings & conveyance of his spirit to make good to you. When you go forward, or shall set upon any attempt what is my desire? but that the Lord would rise up before you & scatter your enemies: and when you rest, that the Lord would returne to the many thousands of Israel. In a word I desire your happiness, & in some respect I could even wish my selfe miserable to attaine my desire. I cannot make an end or give over the multiplication of my soules wishes for your soules & bodies good. I am full of matter, & the spirit within me constraines me to go on; let your love pardon my excesse, it may be the last time that ever you may heare from me, I know not, but might my speech be long as my heart is large, or could it possibly be soe: when should I surcease, these my hartiest benedictions, these my kindest valedictions? Yet I must conquer my selfe & spite of my longing heart to wish longer. Desiring onely this one thing that what good I am not able to intreat God for you, the Lord of his goodness may please freely & fully to give downe upon you all for ever, that so it may come to passe that in all respects & estates what soever wherein you are or may be considered you may in every of them be truly blessed that as men you may be faithfull, as souldiers couragious as Christians gracious, & as Saints glorious, more than these I cannot pray for & I do & will pray that you may never enjoy less from the hands of the living God, who giveth abundantly and upbraideth no man, who sincerely seeketh his face for any present or future favour. And so deare Christians and Brethren, my faithfull & affectionate heart bids you all farewell, you are all beloved of me, & I must now leave you to the love of God, whose power guard you from all evill, grace guide you unto all good, peace rule in your hearts & mercy compasse you about in all estates. As my loving friends I leave you to him that is the helper of the friendlesse. As warriours I leave you to the Lord of Hosts who is the mighty God of battell, as Christians I leave you to Jesus Christ both your Lord and mine. He abide with you, his grace abound in you, his Holy Spirit be your comforter on Earth, your conductor to heaven. And now the God of peace that brought againe from the Dead the Lord Jesus Christ , that great Shephard of the sheepe through the blood of the everlasting covenant make you perfect in every good worke to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever\\n \\nSoe prayeth yours whilst his owne\\n\\nSamuel Jeake\\n',\n",

Your faithfull fellow feeling with the poore oppressed Kingdome, hath hitherto beene manifested in your appearing as a Saviour unto it & your unwearied undertaking for publique good both in former and later actings. You have waded through the Kingdome in blood & carrying your life on the point of your sword have (by the strength of God in you) woone that you weare, & in valour beene victor.\\n Yet it is not unknowne to you that the Kingdome yet groanes (for liberty as Waiting for the manifestacon of the Sonnes of God ) for shall a Nation be borne at once? or in one day delivered from the monstrous Mola’s or conceptions its wombe hath inclosed & hatched these many ages? our miseries were breeding many generations agoe, we must turne over yeares & reignes ere we read their Original, yea runne & rowle beyond the Norman Conquest, & there finde some seeds of our divisions sowne, some men’s wills made laws, some publique persons act to privat ends, & judgment inverted into gall & wormwood, this we know what it meanes by wofull experience our diseases are not of yesterday, they are more desperate than will admit of a tedious cure, & what more bitter! our physicians have beene of no value, our remedies have beene our diseases, he that helped & they that were helpen have both fallen & perished together.\\n But though our freedome be too intricate for man to recuperate yet are we not left either hopeless or helpless, our great Jehovah being engaged to effect it, & for that purpose impower such Actors as majesty from heaven dwells upon, amongst the which your honour challenges the foremost place, the anointing upon you being evidenced by the power with & in you, under whom though but the other day (in the Enemies account) wee were fallen & as dry bones, yet now are Risen & stand upright the tempestuous & thunder threatening cloudes that darkened our Horizon being dispersed through the power of the most High over shaddowing you.

First that as we do fully adhere to the late Remonstrance & are resolved to venture lives & fortunes in defence of the Army in the just prosecution of it: so doe we desire that no delayes (as conceiving them altogether unsafe) may be admitted therein.\\n 2ly considering that want of care & vigilancy (as well as fidelity) in Comittees & others betrusted with publique affaires hath beene the seminary of many evils to this Kingdome: we intreat that care may be taken to refine them, & that such as shall in any waies be obstructers of justice ether by opposing it, or not improving their intrusted power to that purpose may be excluded & also that the like sedulity may be used in removing the Committee of Accompts & appointing others others in their places they being such whose endeavours are more to ensnare than to advance the publique good. 3ly The Kingdomes groaning under the burden of freequarter & (yet) unreasonable taxes, occasioned by the unfaithfull dealing of those entrusted with the publique treasure: requires (as we humbly conceive) some exquisite search: & those being found that have any way abused the state by such fraudulent practises, as to designe the publique treasure to their private advantage deserve to be severly dealt withall.\\n 4ly minding the nakedness of those marine parts & the great dangers we lie exposed to, if any new commotions (which God forbid) should break forth. We earnestly sue that some carefull provision may be made for the sea coast, & especially neere this place the better to strengthen the hands of the Kingdomes friends, & to prevent (at present) unthought of mischiefs. 5ly Being grieved to heare the slanderous aspersions the Army is & hath beene loaded with, notwithstanding its desert to the contrary: we heartily desire, that all such as shall be knowne to asperse them or to act or speake against their proceedings in reference to the execution of justice & righteousness may be brought to condigne punishment.\\n 6ly The principall Actors in and Abbettors of our miserable differences by reason of prominence in some alliance in others with other such wiseblinding bribes have regained strength to rally againe & againe when we had well hoped were irrecoverable: wherefore we humbly intreat your honour that some commissioners may be appointed to find out the Actors & fomenters of the late warre & bringing in of the Scots & being found to secure them or otherwise, without superficial dealing in matters of this concernment. yet a speciall care to be had of the non oppressing their families. Tly Because of the distance of this & many other Garrisons from the Head quarters, & the necessity of intelligence from thence to animate the souldiery & wel affected residing therein, to joyne with and in defense of the just proceedings of the Army: we therefore humbly beseech that there may be an impartiall communication of the Actions of the Army to the respective Garrisons that shall remonstrate with them by such actors as each Garrison shall to that purpose appoint & yet all such of the countrey as either have or shall shew themselves worthy to be confided in may be put in to a posture of defence.\\n ',\n",

But to fight still in the aire, amounts to nothing but vapours of victory. And if to satisfy thee I should administer to the deceased & contract for the payment of some long past debts, purchasing to my selfe trouble enough besides an undoubted resurrection of jealousies (if of no more) that I as conscious to my selfe of former fraude (cuius contrarium verum est*) should now administer which I have till now refused: being assured it will nothing else but expose me & through me the Gospell to the vituperie of the world and resurge matters now more than five yeares obliterate and buried, alwaies minding that it cannot adde to my foelicity, nor enfranchise me, either in point of conscience or the law with any cleerer right or title unto what I anjoy than what | already have & enjoy it with: and yet then not to be certaine of acceptation with thee neither, & so to loose the end of my engagement, would but render me ridiculous, if not Bipedum Stultissimus.”° My friend I confesse with thee, the will of God is a resting point for believers, & therefore I cannot say much though my heart be enlarged, yet had need to desire submission to his will & herein implore your helpe.

I appeale to the barre of judgement, let not passion sway the Scepter nor Will bias your Reason: had I exposed your watch by tongue or hand to publique view (which so let me prosper in your favour & the other world) had I thereby now more than formerly merited a finall exclusion a for-ever excommunication out of your favours? easily this crime augmented by a magnifying glasse to the highest aggravation were but veniall, though I doe professe I know not how it should happen for I neither looked upon it nor wound it up, but when alone, unless some[one] saw me invisibly or pict my pocket when asleepe, but if it were granted which I cannot acknowledge unless I bely my selfe, as you in effect are pleased to say I doe though I can bear that very well from your pen innocently, notwithstanding I say is there no absolution for such a mistake or no intercession for such an errour? Is all compassion banish? is every sparke of respect extinct. Be intreated to be a little more tender-hearted for indeed you are in this unlike your selfe. You say my Deare shortest errours are best, and must this be rankt among the most hainous? Alas! Will nothing les satisfy. Could I improve the greatest favour, as much as you the least mistake I should hope to sinke all my fears, split all my doubts and arrive with safety at the desired Haven. But wo is me! If I have a fair gale one day, I am in danger of shipwrecke the next, so unfortunate is my bitter-sweet voyage. But would you not have me think you picke a quarrell on purpose to make a breach of our society, why doe then upbraid me with my fair but you please to stile them false promises and unregarded now for all kindness.

       " '[24] Richard Hartshorne to Barbara Harding (previously Holman), undated. Original letter. \\nESRO FRE 5269\\n\\nAh my dear (but unkind) Heart\\nHath not all my love merited a line from thee to be satisfied of thy welfare? I have not forgotten since I was promised letters full of kisses, and that often. Prithee my Deare if my love deserue any thing, let me know where thou art, how thou dost, and when I may comfort my languishing and sorrowful heart with hopes to see thee thou never wentest away from me so, but wouldest tell me some time of returne. For my part I take God to witness I am very restles, discontented and cannot tell by what means to injoy any thing of my selfe without thee. I know not and that grieves mee whether this will come to thy hand, if it doenot what shall I doe, oh that I might injoy thee one night instead of every nights dreames on thee. I confes I live a most wretched comfortless solitary and indeed heartles life. Oh that my heart should have such a fresh spring of love, so lasting, and so coming after its deare Jewell & not decay! Truly it makes me astonished and amazed at my selfe. I could (but that experience too sadly convincedth me) have believed it impossible love could after so many sharp incourters, so many grand repulses, remaine unconquered imperfection of it first springing. But God knows I know not any thing thou canst doe to me, or against me, can subdue it. It hath been used too barbarously and heathenishly, yet it is not offended, & that addeth to my misery. My love me thinks tis too unnaturall to render contempt for love, slighting for a deare affection. Thou know it how boundless my love hath been, how unfeigned I need not here rehearse, and how durable the weariness of my many & great repulses too much to testify. Is there noe reward for vertue? Is there no jewell transparent but gold? Ah my Dear Heart consider how many have been ruined by breaking their engaged faith & promise there isa time for every thing and certainly if thou wast afraid of God’s Judgements in poor Mr Harding’s case I know not how it can be otherwise, may I believe tis much worse in mine: for I suppose he might in proces of time have married another, I must not. Thou wouldst be accounted iust in thy dealing, I pray God give thee a heart to be so to me but yet I believe never poor lover had more iniury and harder dealing than I have. Good my Dear Heart think upon me, and consider what I suffer for thy sake, poise the burden that lies on my heart but in thy thoughts, make but my case thine a little & weigh it in equity and doe not let all my life be spent in sorrows, and all comforts taken from me att all my Daies. I would I could but send thee one of my present bitter groanes or that thou mightest but for the twinkling of an eye feel my aking heart, surely thy closed nature could not but relent and a little dissolve from its frozen hardnes. The God of Heaven mollify thy hard hart and make it more naturall and not so stony to me. I know thou expectest mercy at Gods hands (which I pray God grant in the hour at death & day of Judgement) but how canst though looke for any & exercise so much cruelty and falseness. Indeed if there were not another world it would not at all matter what our actions were, but my Love there will be atime of searching all the secrets of our hearts, no covers nor pretences can cloake us from the all seeing eye of God. Didst thou ever read or canst thou believe faithless & merciles shall find mercy without repentance or amendment? Thous hast separated mee from the society of men & from thy presence I must be excluded. What heart is able to beare and endure these, this hard measure and not complain? Or who can undergo so great a punishment. Where poor Mr Harding had one trouble I must have 20. The God of heaven some way put an end to my wretchedness or my life or some way helpe me. I am not able to sustaine this cruelty. Poor I that want nothing can be laid to my charge, but that I am not borne toa great inheritance, that only abound in love and poverty, the last [word lost] the former filthy and of noe beauty. A better fortune [may] make a lesser love far more worthy in thy eyes, have a better lustere though never to good a relish. I waited a Saturday [to see] poor little Bab but when I consider her parting from mee [words lost] it even makes me curse the day of my birth & the hour when it was said a son is borne. She cald moda, moda, moda* {words lost] shall not do away! Truly I am not satisfied at her [word lost] though I found the old woman having her on her knee, but the house is old & the roofe is much unthatcht and open to the cold & raine. Good dear heart therefore take some care of thy deare babe she yet complains of her poor belly, but is merryish & something chearfull [words illegible] a teach as well as she can speake, & I beseech & conjured thee to returne home again thy business being dispatcht that was undertaken and make noe quivocations with my poor heart, nor delaies to take care of thy dear Image.

Wilt thou never assuage this scorching flame? Hast thou only added fewell to make a sacrifice? If it were ligated what more comfortable? continually fed, what more cruell? Oh that I had any thing but bitterness, teares, & a broken heart to send thee: I would I had the treasures of the Indians to make access for my Petition or the fortune of ten thousand [words illegible] than I for my succes. But thou hast only loved mee to make me miserable, a by-word and a spectacle which my misery too sadly proves, wert thou not mine by the comfort of thy fond dear Heart (how often given I shall not say) I would ingeniously acknowledge my importunity presumption and more then [word illegible] but what is freer then gifts? or what can be more mine owne then what is freely given? Nay and if thou avert not that inestimable Pearle farre above the worth of this faire world. I should not account thee worth my seeking. but alas my dull pen cannot describe thy Deare value that my forlorne and dying heart hath put upon thee. If I had only Complements to devise my fancy might be undervalued by its invention but I have nothing but faithlessnes & broken promises to breake my broken heart. Oh that it might be broken at once for all, that I might once put an end to my grevious & just complaint! Could I have found any meanes to quench this burning flame, I would not send to thee who wilt rather suffer my to dye for thirst then give a drop of water to coole my scorched heart. If thou enduredst such a captivity so cruel a prison, so bad companions, and with all soe continually inbittered with most exquisite Torment thou wouldst thinke it were more then barbarous, more cruel then heathenish, more savage then bestiall. but I, poor I, have lost my Reason, the guide of my life, my liberty, the inioyment of my selfe, my hopes, the comfort of my beeing, what have then I left but a life not worth the name. I am sure death is a thousand times more acceptable to mee then anything I enioy.\\n If others covet thee, thou art pleased to say thou wilt not forget what is betwixt thy selfe & me, alas, if thou deny them, am I any better than they? And have not they as much as I nay more they are at liberty, so am not I, they may make a new choice, so cannot I, they may have many, I must not have one, mine owne. Surely thy thoughts are very bad of mee and thy love very small to mee to say I may make a new choyce when thou knowest I am bound under an eternall course to marry none but thy deare selfe. It is not a wife, nor a woman that I so much dote upon a tis none but thee who to me art the quintessence of all thy sexe, who though thou art so cruell wouldst give my soule to Hell, God I hope will have more mercy for it. But why (if it be lawfull to expostulate) didst thou urge me to engage my selfe by tongue, who was thy own in heart long before and told thee I rather desired to doe it my [word illegible] as thou knowest to this day, and now thus to sleight all my love, to eat up all thy promises in effect, and pretend to give me my liberty againe prithe tell me, can a man hanged dead have his life restored? but be it soe, twas thy will. I satisfied it and it had satisfied mee had it been the same as I have been, had it been true as I have been to the swearing away of my life, my misery will never redound to thy honour, nor the breach of thy promises make thee happy. For I beseech thee consider thy dealing with me, than knowest none hath above one heart (but thy selfe) how long thou hast had 2 thou art not ignorant, doe but tell me then with what I shall love another woman? Besides have I had so good success that if I were at liberty I could hope to be more fortunate. God blesse me till then and not longer. But alas my Dear Heart tis nothing for thee to bid one leaden to run that cannot go. I am sure thou wast pleased in thy deare arms to call me husband, before I durst dare to honour my selfe with the name of wife. But I perceive thy [word illegible] is apart of thy selfe subject to forget what it loves not, & very to continue in the contrary. I visit thy Dear Bab last Saturday that I might kisse mine owne. Why dost thou tell me thou canst not satisfy my Love God hath made thee willing, there wants nothing but performance. Thou toldst me thou marriedst twice against thy will why not a third time to thy poor friend? See if thou canst perswade thy hard heart a little to relent and with mee I beg of as for my life a faster hand since (my heart) thou thinkst I deserve thee for my love before the God of Heaven conscious of my love & thy promises I beg, beg & beseech thee let me be once rewarded with that treasure which I am devoted to serve and honour to the breathing out of my last gasps, which if this may not be I pray the God of Heaven put an end to my long lingering sorrowes & give thee peace and forgive thy hard dealing to\\n \\nThy Poor distressed but ever\\n\\nLoyall servant\\n\\nRichard Hartshorne\\n\\nThese for my dear but unkind Mrs Barbara Harding\\n',\n",

These, indeed, thankfully arrived. For I feared that either my or your previous letters had perished on the way. May favour be present with health, and I cordially desire for you the same mercy, But if I shall ever have been ill, I will most speedily send you word, {and] I pray that in this case, may it be far from me to neglect or scorn your love. Such thoughts had never entered into my mind, nor (by God’s grace) will they enter. I have heard no word of the plague since the arrival of Thomas Shoosmith. I have seen a bill of mortality in which none died of the plague. Although the bill does not engender much faith, I heard from D. Martin (with Thomas Shoosmith present) that two had died. Today I asked uncle; he did not swear that a boy died in this parish when Thomas Shoosmith was accompanying me. After this I have heard nothing. Aunt is waiting for Mary Key, who has now recovered. Uncle also greets you. My cousin is well. I bought Buxton’s Treasury of Volsius’ Rhetoric concerning the size of the kernel of Amosius, 559 pages, and John Bulwer’s Pathomyatomia, a small octavo, 240 pages, and 6s. 6d. I set out for D. Gingey and spoke to his wife. She said that if I send a bill of sale, this would be payment for a thirtieth part of a ship. I handed over the letter to Mr Boys. He will send you a reply. I have received £10 from Mr Boucker; I have seen M. W. Stedd at whose instruction I have released £10 to his servant, [and] introduced the receiver of his letter. I saw Mr Allin. Friendly greetings to T. Shoosmith, with [his] mother etc. Lask your prayers as well for my soul as for my body; I remain desirous of hearing of your safety; I have written very hurriedly.\\n \\nYour most obedient son\\n\\nSamuel Jeake junior\\n',\n",

Behold now is the acceptable time, & this the day of salvation, to day therefore heare his voice, get a true sight of sinne & a hatred of it & holy purposes & earnest prayers against it & although an answer come not presently yet every delay is not a deniall God will come & tarry not. Looke into the freeness of grace in the Gospell tendered to unworthy soules, thiefe sinners &c. who have no money or prize in their hands to buy or purchase & if you can do no more yet hope, and wait for God hath promised to be gracious to the soule that waiteth for him he knows our strength & remembers that we are but dust & he will not contend for ever, we are not choise of mercy because we believe are holy &c but because we should believe & be holy being chosen thereunto. In all with Gods free grace and Christs free laying downe his life even when we were enemies do sufficiently demonstrate our inability & insufficiencie to procure merit purchase worke out or deserve our owne salvation & if so why should you or any other that is sensible of sinne & brought into a longing after & loving of Jesus Christ thinke your selves excluded. Where hath God excluded any that are become willing to be divorced from their sinnes and married to their saviour? That God hath touched your heart is good, that he will heal it as well as wound it I doubt not, & if he hide his face some time he will after two daies revive & you shall live in his sight.

We see but one way to doe any good which in short is if you see any likelihood of buying a lesser quantity as of 200 or 150 or if not above 120 quarters Winchester, & can be certain to fit freight a vessell to what you buy it & freight her from Padstow to Rye with it for 2s the Winch[ester] quarter or thereabouts; If you judge it to be effected and could for a beginning buy SO quarters or more of good wheat at 12 or 13 your bushel of 21 gallons as you write the price it was then its possible you might pick up enough in smaller parcells to freight a small vessell provided you can have one in your Port. And we should be content to advance to 14 your bushel if the cargo might be made up at different prizes not exceeding that. If you have any prospect of accomplishment it will be requisite to be very diligent & speedy & yet to do it without clamour, if you could make a beginning & buy some indiff[erent] parcells of the principal farms we hope the rest might comply & not advance much. We cannot allow more time for the buying & shipping it then a month after the receipt of this Letter. So if you can effect it as above you must not lose any time but fall to buying immediately with what privacy you can, And for moneys draw on Mr Walter Monkeat at the Goate in Lothbury London. Your bills shall be well paid, And if you fraight a vessell must agree with the master to stay 14 days at Rye & if you can get him under 2s per quarter Winch[ester] but for a small matter we must not stand. We desire your answer per first & if you proceed then every post or two as the business goes forward. But if you see that neither such a quantity can be bought nor a vessell hired at Padstow then pray desist altogether & only favour us with a Line of answer.\\n ',\n",

As for beaff also he hath allowed him Bread & Beere which is more than was allowed me when I was a Clerk, He hath constantly hot meat for dinner & bread & butter or cheese for supper which is as much as I allow my own children, & the course I have always observed in house-keeping, which was never so traduced (as I know of till now) till this done by your son, His Ribaldry I complain off is down right bawdry, no man I beleeve can think me so [word lost] or ridiculous to accuse him for such things for asking for Victualls only, besides he was generally doing mischiefe (whereof I have severall instances) to the goods in & about my house. And though catched in the Act yet did as impudently deny all as he doe to you his ribaldry, for your sake I am willing to trye him a little longer hopeing his Amendment, which if he doth not we shall not continue long togather, And as for the Termes if he should persist in his impudence & by Acting & writeing lyes endeavour to expose me, that shall be settled by indifferent persons.

But this poor man hath never seen him since, and the person hath been to demand the money of him, and the Bayleys lye in wait to take him, that he is faine to keep within doors and dares not stirr out for fear of being sent to prison. I would have had him write down to his Mother but he was very earnest with me to write because he said he feared that his [word struck out] writing would not be understood, which seeing the man in so much distress I promised him to write to you, that you might acquaint Coz Hartshorne with it and if it is thought convenient may order that the money [words struck out] may be paid for I believe if he were in prison he is not able to procure tenn shillings for his reliefe, and now is not in a capacity to follow his own concernes, I went this morning to inquire for this Stead att Staples inn but he went out of town yesterday that I could give you no better account than what I had from Clerk who made such a sad complaint to me that I much commiserated the man’s condition and thought my self in confidence bound to signify to you what I have that the poor man may be in a capacity to follow his imploy and therefore hope you will resolve this trouble.

But if you cannot meet otherwise to enjoy any season of joyning your forces to send up your petitions to heaven without distraction you were better meet with that number then not att all. If the Lord deprive or suffer the Adversaries rather to deprive you of your solemne Assemblies, the sin will be the enemies, the suffering yours. I do not think the loss or deprivation of some ordinances will separate God & his people, seeing he was with the congregation in the wilderness when they wanted circumcision & the Passover & at first had no settled priesthood or ministry among them.

And after the terme is done a mortgage may be made from him (in which his wife need be no party nor is it convenient she should) but the party to whom they levied the Fine may be a party (& if by the Indenture leading the uses of Fine there be any to serve for his consent to such disposal must be a party) otherwise the mortgage to run as usual, & so far as I see by the expression of the uses in your Letter need be no party but the mortgage may be made only from W™ Eaton who had the sole power to dispose, nor need there any mention of the Fine in the mortgage, but it will be meet the mortgage have the part of the Indenture that leads the uses of the Fine left in his custody. Mr Drinkers mortgage I was paid for but whether it lye in the upper drawer of the court cupboard or in the little Box under the little Table, or in one of the Boxes between the little Table & the north wall I remember not. The Accompt of Mr Samson and Mr Holman touching Richard Youngs two children I were not paid for. You may take for them what you think reasonable I had not much trouble to write them. The Ryot charged on Sheriff Pilkington, Shute and severall others™ was found against them last saterday at which tryal it is said the L. C. J. carried himself some passionately yet it is thought is not very easie in his place and either his dismission or resignation is expected. Yet since the trial a writ of Error is granted. Prince George the K of Denmarkes brother is expected shortly to came over & marry the Duke of Y daughter Anne, and tis said will be made Duke of Cumberland.” Some talk yet continues of a parliament about Michaelmas next. Sir Patience Ward is charged with perjury in his deposition at the tryal of the Scandalum Magnatum against Y & to come to his tryal they say next saterday.” The Argument for the Hartfordshire men upon the stat of the 23th of Eliz is to be argued too morrow it is thought the Judges will declare against the dissenters thereupon though yet that court hath shuffled off their judgment thereon openly in court so far as I hear what ever their particular opinions have been in private.

It is very strange to me to consider that you can in the least Imagine me safe here when I am dayly sought after and alwaies driven out from place to place in such a hazzardous wayes as perhaps you cannot believe. I were in Yorke buildings with Mr Bulger where we were surprised about | a clock at night with a search of 2 or 300 men so that we were both forced naked as we were out on the Topp of the house and if it had not beene for the pittifullness of some of the gentry that let us into their Garretts we had beene both taken. They shott their guns at us as we were on the houses but missed us. This is the Second escape from thence. Mother do but do as my Brother advised you to that is use your reason and you will do well enough but as you do now I am sure you do not. In the first place can you Imagine me safe in England and in the next place can believe that £10 will carry me to France. [word illegible] | have none Periwiggs I have none nor any sort of linen but just to my backe now nor shoes nor boots nor any thing that is fit or necessary for such a journey. Mother if you do but think on these things impartially you cannot but find your the errours of your judgement not to be small in this case. I have no horse neither. Pray send a letter by this Porter and tell me your mind as short as you can whether you had rather see me hanged than [word illegible] alive and in a good condition in another countrey. Consult what I have written here whether this is not very reasonable [word illegible] best be with my Brother whom I doubt not but you will believe when I were in Prison you grudged that charge but would not remedy it by getting me a Pardon or [word illegible] and now I have done it without your knowledge or helpe only by good natured strangers to whom I owe my life for their kindness to get me a Pardon you would not, as you said to backe me you would not because you dared not for feare should run away now I were told by your selfe as well as others that you would straighten your self and lay down so far as £200 would go all what I have saved as well as the other charge for before I could have beene cleared. If I had escaped hanging it would in all things have cost you between £50 or 60 thou you proposed to comply and compound that would have cost you £100 or more with charges and now for one quarter of the money that it would have cost you for my Pardon I can in all probability save my life by going beyond sea and for you to strike out and [word illegible] me that seems to not that you never designed my good or preservation because the sum is so much less than what you said you would give for my Pardon which I must needs [word illegible] if I should be taken but I hope to save that for I very much doubt and have a great deal of reason to believe that I should have no Pardon since my life is not worth £50 there hath beene a horse lost that there hath beene more proferred to find him than you are now willing to give for my life. Suppose that I were taken to night as God knows whether I shall or no I have little reason to beleive that if I should have a Pardon if £50 would buy it but I dare be positive that £500 would not, for you proferred to go as farr as £200 but I do am forced to believe you did but flatter me because in the first place you proffered it in the next place that when you saw it might be had you would not performe it all this treates jelousy in me to thinke you never designed to save my life and now in a manner convinces me that you had rather I should be hanged than not. People that were absolutely strangers to me that might have £100 rather than faile £200 and want bread besides where I lye will not betray my life but would rather go to Goale, severall that have [words struck out] beene brought upon their Oathes (who are strangers to me) to know where I were or whether they did not bring Tooles to bring me out though they really did it and had a reward put in their hands of 30 guineas to discover me refused both and also did their soules so much injury as to sweare falsely. I have no freind in the whole world now I see plainely what I never mistrusted nor would have believed if 10000 men had sworn that you had lay downe £50 for my life but this looks very suspitious. Perhapps you may do do as you do with the Imagination that I have other friends that will do any thing for me but believe me I speake it from my soul and desire never to escape this trouble I am in if I know any one in this world that will give me £20 to save my life sure [you] cannot thinke that if I had so much money as I do here desire which is but £40 in all that I would be so greate a sott and seeke my owne Ruine so apparently as to stay in England in so much visible danger of my life which is as sweete to me as yours is to loose you if you this kepe. Pray put the money into any bodies hands you can trust and let them not give me a penny till I am aboard and going off, if I should go to France as Iam without money friend acquaintance or Creditt I must be forced to steale and there I should be starved in Gaole and hanged at last, Mr Bulger whose father spent more than £1000 to get him a pardon and ruined him selfe to do that is come to see his son and had but £12 in all the world hath given it him and his friends & acquaintances have raised him £100 as I am told though they never expect it againe and all this for to save his life they will do and more if neede required it & since in all probability this will be the last that I shall desire of you I pray to God to open your heart this case and never no more do I do find it to be so hard to me as to provide what I have of thus heartily begged of a Mother whom no body would believe but that the naturall tie of affection should stirr you up to this most charitable deed towards me who am \\nDeare Mother\\n\\nYour poore distressed yet dutifull son\\n\\nRich.

But I refer this and all other matters to your more mature determination. After I had so eminently hazarded my life and fortune in accusing and actually apprehending Aaron Smith and Simon and Samuel Maypn, by virtue of your warrant and that of three Deputy Lieutenants to search for and seize arms, etc., and by the assistance of several parties of militia horse assigned by the Earl of Bridgwater, I made a strict search for above twenty days and nights together and seized a great quantity of concealed arms, etc., at Mr. Wharton's and Mr. Hampden’s and narrowly missed Goodenough and Ayliffe at Enfield and also at Sir Roger Hill’s. After Lord Paget and Justice Newman had trepanned me out of Whitehall and secured me without warrant or commitment a day and night close prisoner and without warrant seized and perused some of my private papers, and after I was released by you and committed four days to a messenger’s custody and on an examination before a Cabinet council, then and not till then Lord Paget and Sir Roger, to stiffle my testimony, pretended I had robbed them in searching their houses, whereon I was recommitted to the Gatehouse to be prosecuted, but I was confined above five months and neither prosecuted, tried, bailed or discharged though | thrice tendered 10.000/. bail. At last Lord Paget shrank his pretensions to an indictment of trespass only and suffered that too to sleep for four sessions, so that at last I was forced to impanel a jury at my own charge and give notice of trial at Hicks’ Hall, but then to deprive me of the defence I had there made ready of witnesses and counsel he removed the cause and without notice tried it by surprise at the Old Bailey.\\n Sir Roger resolves to prosecute me at the next Aylesbury assizes, 3 March. The guards assigned to assist us in our said search of Lord Paget’s and Sir Roger's house are a party of Sir Francis Compton’s troop and are our only witnesses. My life and reputation lie at stake and can be preserved only by their testimony at the trial. Being a young man and rendered defenceless through a long imprisonment, I am altogether incapable of taking such effectual measures as my case requires. Since I have fallen under these unhappy circumstances and through my said services have created many inveterate animosities amongst the factious party, and Lord Paget and Sir Roger and others through their instigation have made great stickling to stiffle my evidence and irritate his Majesty and Council and yourself against me, I hope you will not prejudge my cause but consider there is always a malignant party always ready to stigmatize those that are most loyal and indefatigable to serve his Majesty. Therefore | pray your favourable assistance that the said party of the Guards may be specially ordered to attend and give their testimony on my behalf at my trial at Aylesbury and that all my said warrants and papers may be forthwith redelivered me or secured in some safe hands ready to produce at my trial. \",\n",

For there will be no money to be had on them till next summer at soonest. Mine that I have remaining of that year come to £12 for which I shall have £10 4s at that rate which if I can get I am inclined to take: Now I write you that you may let my Mother know of it, she has £40 in Tickets of that year which at 3s per £ discount will make but £34. If she be willing to sell hers at the same rate I will do my endeavor for it. I think it will be the best way, for then she will be nothing behind till next Michaelmas: But if I can{not] meet with an opportunity to sell them, then she must either keep them till next summer when it’s thought the Parliament will provide for [word lost] payment or else if she care to buy 16 Bla[nk] Tickets more which she may have at 17s [word lost] she may purchase a Reversion of some [word lost] life with them & those she has for which she may have £14 per ann when the party dyes, if the security continue.

I thought would be more welcome to you from my hand than another, though I doubt not but other Letters will come assoon to the same purpose. Tis I believe now certain, this coming by express from Holland, with this account that the peace was signed last Friday night by the Plenipotentiarys of England, Holland, Spain & France with liberty for the Emperor to sign in such a time and Strasburgh to be restored to the Empire or the Equivalent which of the Two the Emperor chuses. The King is now expected over in a very short time. And things will look with a good face again. Bank stock was yesterday at 86 & I thought to have ventured another 100 today or tomorrow. But to day morning assoon as I went out he[ard] the welcome news of peace which [thanks] be God is much better. For now to day at Exchange time Bank stock was at 98 a good rise in a days time. So that now I have given over all thought of buying hoping ‘twill rise so that so that I [may] think of selling before long.

Pray don’t trouble me with any errands, I pray tell Mr Tucker I was in Southwark to day, but could hear no news from Sturbridge Fair. Mr Travell told me hops had some stur on them, at least would not go currant at above £10 or £10 5s there I think it not prudence to run much above 9 in the Country, for now there is a peace there will be a noise made of the importing of forrain hops. I wrote you last I did not care to go above £150 deep in that commodity. As to flax seed buy what you can, but do not exceed what I ordered for now forrain flaxseed will be imported.

I would have you imploy Goddin when you want any help about the flaxseed, and of all you buy get it in assoon as you can, for when there is a quantity of 30 or 40 quarters I intend to have it to London. As for money if my mother be willing to let you have £30 I will pay interest for that which with what you have will do for the present & £10 I suppose Mr Curtis will bring soon after Michaelmas. But if you find you shall want more let me know a week before you think you shall need it & I can have it here, for Mr Miller being to have % will pay his part here, & I shall take care to remitt it you. I would have you send to Colman the Tailor & tell him before my Mother (who may be a witness) that if he intend to stay in my house I shall not let it under 50s per year. Only because he may be unprovided I will condescend that he may tarry till Ladyday at the rate of 40s per annum. And know his mind one way or other before Michaelmas day. Then after you have done this send to Mr John Curteis junior or his wife & give them warning either to continue in my house at £4 per annum or else to leave it at Ladyday, be sure give warning before Michaelmas. I shall never get any rent of them & therefore I must take this occasion & now there is peace I do not fear a Ten{an]t. If Colman refuse tocontinue as above then you may tell Mrs Curtis if she will remove thither at 50s per year, she may which I will admit of because she was your midwife, for I shall be always troubled to get the Rent.

I would fain stay a little longer in hope the Bank will rise higher & though it costs me something more here in expenses & diet it must do if I continue here then it would do at home, yet I hope your saving there will make some compensation for it. I do think it may be worth my while to stay a month longer & to see how things will be when the king comes over, which I believe will give the stock another rise. I cannot sell our tickets at 17 therefore I mean to keep them, for I think they will be paid next year.

But I have my health very well I bless God for it. Tell Mr Tucker that I have been in Southwark this afternoon to enquire about Hops. & now they tell me that Hops were run down at Sturbridge fair before it was done to £8 10s per hundred though I understand it was because the weather was very wet & dirty & they sold so rather than carry them back to London, some say there is a good crop in Flanders & many are expected from thence. There lyes our greatest danger in bringing over Flemish hops. The market in Southwark is dull from £9 10s to £9 15s or £10. But tomorrow is the great market day for hops there & Mr Travel has promised me to send me by penny post how they go there & I will not fail to give him further advice by next post. But I believe it will be a dull market. For the weather being so very wet they will come up in a dirty condition & being dull already are not like to quicken this week. In the mean time I think it best to forbear buying any more till he hears further. And as for those already bought I am clear of opinion to send them up assoon as possible, for after this dulness it’s very like they may quicken again in October & then we shall be ready for the market before forrain hops can possibly come in. Besides the price being considerable it will be best to make our returns assoon as we can. Mr Miller & wife &c remembers to you, to my mother & Betty, as also to Mr Tuckers.

I am told that the Million Lottery Tickets which will be now due this 29\" of Sept. 1697, will be paid first soon after Michaelmas, which makes me sorry that I did not cut them off & bring up with me.** Therefore I would have you some day next week when you are at leisure, to look in my Chest & you will find uppermost a large bag with papers in it amongst which you will find one parcell superscribed [Benefit Tickets in the Million Adventure]” open it & cut off neatly one payment which you will find dated 29 — Sept. 1697 both of my Mother’s benefit & mine. Then under the said Bag you will find 2 parcells of blank Tickets which are my Mothers & mine, 20 in each. Take them & cut off the payments which you find dated 29. Sept. 1697. You may observe how to cut them off by observing how the former have been cut, tis best done with a penknife. When you have them all off the Total will come to £55 viz: my Mothers benefit £10 & her 20 blanks & my benefit £5 & my 20 blanks. Then double them once & fold them up in a brown paper or two & so put them in a letter directed to me at Mr Millers in Dunstan Court Mincing Lane & keep them till Mr Harris or Mr Tucker come to London & desire either of them to bring it to me & if I not be Within to leave it with Mr Miller or his wife (you need not tell Mr Harris what itis, only desire him to have a great care of it there being papers of concern in it). 1am within always at 3. a clock afternoon to be sure.

You do very well about the flaxseed. I do not find any rise of the prizes here so keep at 35s per quarter the highest unless you think fit to 36s for any prime parcell but be sure don’t exceed that for any. Don’t go after Reubens if he don’t come to you let it go for we had better sit still then buy too dear. If Tho: Morrow don’t come till November, I hope you may have it all in in October & if he will carry it reasonable I had rather have it by him because I have imploy’d him before. I suppose he will not expect above 2s per quarter now there’s peace. You may also ask him if he will carry it & at what price & let me know. You will have time enough for you cannot have all in this month. As to wheat you must buy as the market price is what you want. I don’t trouble my self about your buying the Horse but seeing you may either take or leave him till maytide you need not resolve yet till I come home which hope may be in November for I am desirous to see another dividend at the Bank which will be at the end of October hoping that may advance it something more. However I have received my Bonds this morning & cancell’d them & have also received £31 10s besides in money for my dividend of 3 4 p Cent. The Stock is sunk a little viz to 96 but there’s nothing in it but the humour of the people. I am sorry to hear my Mother is ill, & you also I will take care about the Prunes if I can get those that are good. I wish you would accustom yourself to drink more, & then I believe it would be better. I am glad to hear Mr Tucker & his wife are on recovery. I have wrote to him severall times to send the Hops up his father bought by way of Maidston but hear nothing from him. I would fain have them sent up assoon as possible. Now they are dull indeed between 9 & £10 per hundr[ed] but the charge of standing is inconsiderable now they are at so great a price & here we shall have them ready fora market. For now we expect peace will be proclaimed next week at furthest & then there will be fitting of ships to sea apace for Irela[nd] & the West Country & much brewing here, so that it’s very likely they may be quick in a fortnight, but perhaps not hold so long.

For I can use the money I have here to pay for my part of the hops Mr Tucker bought & perhaps I may meet with something else that may be probable to do well. However if you think not fit to do so, draw it on me for you shall not want as long as I have it. I hope I may return by the middle of November. But I would fain tarry till then. I wrote you word last post to mind Mr Tucker to send up the hops which I think of greater importance to me than the flaxseed because they come to more money, & are a hazardous commodity. I wonder I hear nothing from him nor his father as if they minded it not though to me it seems of concern. The Bank is at 96 & I hope now ina very good condition our bills being at par. For now I hear any one may have his money upon the old sealed Bills, & after the 10\" of Oct it’s said the Bank will allow no interest for any sum under £100 & for all greater sums put in they allow now but 3 per Cent which I doubt not but will raise the stock. I wrote you before, I have my dividend & bonds in. And the latter end of this month we do expect another of 2 2/3 per Cent which will be to me £26 13s 4d so I would stay this month to see what effect this will have upon the stock. I was about buying another 100 if I could have got it for 95 but I think not to exceed that. For if it rise above 100 I intend to sell some. I think never more to give above 100 as I did before. I am heartily sorry I am forc’t to give you so much trouble about flaxseed but I know not how to help it my concerns being so great here. There are [no] good Prunes to be got at London however I sent you 14lb of the best that were to be had which yet are none of the best though very dear 4d per lb.

I will not give you so much trouble as to send the flaxseed but tell Morrow I shall not send it till after Christmas which as it will free you from that fatigue which I would not by any means should fall upon you; so we think also it will come to a better market toward spring than now.

But if Mr Tucker did not tell you about Guineas it was his fault for I desired him particularly to acquaint you & I thought he might have done so much. To day in the Gazett is an advertisement that they [guineas] shall be taken for Custom & Excise &c at 22s. so that I am apt to think they may pass a while & many do take them so here for goods I believe no body refuses them.

There’s no money on the Million Lottery. Several of the Proprietors are to meet next Wednesday to concert the best methods to obtain the Arrears where I intend to be with them.

You have done very well about Snoads flaxseed. Nevertheless if he should bring it in & insist upon your agreement I would have no difference with him but would give him 34s p quarter if he be so satisfied. For I would have every body easy that I deal with: Or if you find him much dissatisfied (as you know at the return of your messenger) I had rather give 36s then have any brawling about it. And so you may send him word if you find it convenient. For it’s a pretty great quantity & if it be very good 1am willing to have it, for I find there will not be much more to be had. If he have brought it in before you receive this then it must be adjusted when I return. But as for any other parcells I say as before give not above 32s per q[uarter]. Nor above 20s for white. I wrote to Mr Tucker to furnish you with £30 & that Iwould pay so much the more here towards the hops. But if he cannot or be not free then you must put away some Guineas for my mother at 22s as they go currant for Goods. Or you may draw £30 on me. Only if you draw on me let me know when you write again which way you intend to make use of that my money may be ready. I hope you are better in health & am glad to hear my little girl is mending.

But if any extraordinary business should make my stay necessary till the week after I may then continue the horse here till that time. I mean chiefly in reference to the Bank which is now at 90 or 91 & some think we shall have a dividend ordered the 15 of December at which time will be a General Court. And this would make it rise higher were it not for fear some Tally men will petition the Parliament fora new engraftment, yet I think there is no real fear [of] it. I am told they begin to pay some [of] the Annuities. So I intend to see about that next Tuesday. I send you the Kings speech which is worth you reading & hope things will go well with us at last. I hope to be at home before the Gooders come I intend them 6d a piece. I would not have you take the Guineas unless youcould put them away immediately as you took them, nor meddle with any Pistols for they are worth but 17s 4d.

But I won’t give you any trouble to ship it, for there is no such hast, I have sold it & am at liberty to send it when I please. I have received % s Annuitys at the Exchequer which is £9 10s so there’s less behind. I have paid Mr Thompson his £100 & taken in my bond. I have bought £100 stock for my mother in the bank, & £100 more for myself at 89 per Cent which is to be transferred to morrow on which day there is a General Court & we expect a dividend will be ordered of 4 per Cent which will reduce the stock I bought for my mother & self this day to 85. It was uncertain whether it would come lower, & therefore I thought it best for her to be concerned a little in it as it is which I hope will do well. I shall take care to pay for it here & reckon with her when I come home. Tell Mr Tucker I would not have him draw any money for the hops till I return for if they [will] take the £100 due at xmas for hops at Rye I can pay it better there.

I had a letter from Mr Tournay that he will be at Rye to morrow and pay the money there; The Butter is come by Tho: Morrow. Madam Miller says that Trains are worn still with womens upper petticoats but not so long as formerly; And as for fringes she saith they wear them strait but she would not advise you to alter any for they are worn both ways, Twas a good time to have bought in the Bank yesterday for it fell from 105 to 104 upon a blind story of the Frenches coming. But that being blown over it rose again today to 104’. As for telling when ‘tis a good time to purchase that’s past my skill or any body’s else. I have taken up sixty five pounds of Mr Newman of Winchelsea for which I gave him a note payable the 26\" of May before which time I hope to be at home. Madam Miller desires to know whether the silk you would have drawn with Indian sprigs be for a Mantua or for a Lining, for she saith if it be for a Mantua it will be so very tedious for you to work it that she would rather advise you to have it painted with lively flowers which shews exceeding well & may be done for about 15s & will wear very well provided it don’t come to wet which you will have no occasion to use it in. So she would have you send word next post. I cannot yet meet with any iron kettles that hold above 8 gallons or 10 at most. So have not bought yet. I have received one & Twenty pounds & nineteen shillings of Tho: Morrow for which I being absent Mr Miller hath drawn a bill upon you this day by my order paiable at sight to one Mr John Atkins or order, which I desire you to pay when bought to you. I think he is a Lydd* man but that is not material. Take a Receit on the bill when you pay it, If he come not himself then see if his name be endorsed on the bill or else do not pay it. I have spoke to Mr Ferris & he saith he will write to Robt Brown to let you have 2 Retum the first he can.

I pray God continue it & restore your health & to him return thanks and in all your ways acknowledge him & he shall direct your pathes. I suppose the pain of your head may return again, but if it do be not out of heart: as it returns so it may remove. Man is born to trouble. Endeavor to make a sanctified use of all afflictions, & let all the dispensations of providence draw you nearer to God & more off from the world in which you are but a stranger as the Apostle speaks of the believer in the 11\" of the Hebrews who did not take up their rest in this world but looked for a City that hath foundations whose builder & maker is God. Look upon sin as the greatest Evil of all & pray to God not to lead you into Temptation. Avoid all occasions of sin, lest you be left to your own strength & fall, Keep in the way of God’s providence & in doing your duty & then you may expect his protection. Chuse affliction always rather than iniquity. These directions that I give you will be of use to you in after times as well as now even thro the whole course of your Life. It is a comfort to me that I have observed in you some good thing towards the Lord God of Israel & I trust he will perfect that good work he has begun in your conversion to him to serve the living God.

Copy letter with heading.\\nESRO FRE 4223 fo. 60\\n\\nMy Letter to Mrs Wenborn of Mayfield who before was the wife of Mr John\\n\\nWilmshurst*\\n\\nGodly friend\\nYou may thinke me too bold in presuming to present these confused lines unto your view, which will but trouble you to read but more trouble to me to write in regard of the old friendship & acquaintance betweene you & my mother having now this opportunity could not but acquaint you with that which I wish rather you had beene an eye witness of, even the death of my dearest friend under God. It is now .22. weekes ago she finished her course, she sickened first like an Ague, upon the 29\" of October being Tuesday, on the wednesday she went out to Goodman Millers to repetition, the thursday the fit tooke her againe & held her as before, & on the friday she went out to a buriall which was the last time she was forth. On the Saterday she was tooke againe & so it held her all night & the next day being Sabbath she was very sicke, yet in the Afternoone she rose, but still continuing sicke, on the Monday as she lay, she read the .102. Psalme,” for the Lord seemed to hide himselfe from her, but he did not forsake her over long, in that night hee revealed himselfe to her in a sweet manner, so that her bruised bones leapt for joy, in the morning she revealed to us what a sweet night she had enjoyed, & how the Lord had let out him selfe to her from these words of the .36. Psalme 5.6.7.8.9. verses” and that now she had found by experience what we have yet but by promise, that heaviness may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning. Continuing sicke we sought to the Physician, this weeke like a Saint, her words ministered grace to the hearers, & she was perswaded she should dye on the Sabbath & that having done a weekes work she should enter into his rest yet God otherwise prevented & that Satan might take his last farewell of troubling her tooke occasion hereby to molest her but at length the Lord revealed himselfe to her more fully then before, so that about the middle of the weeke she told us she was as full of joy as her heart could hold. The Lord had now afflicted her with a sore mouth, which much troubled her to speake, about the latter end of the weeke we had good hope of her recovery, but God ordered it better for her gaine though for our losse, on the saterday night & Sabbath following she could take downe nothing but beere & suger with a feather & on the monday & tuesday she waxing worse & worse, we had little hope of life left in her, on the Wednesday being the .20\". day of November about .4. a clocke in the afternoone she sweetly yielded up her soule into her Fathers hands, catching up her hands together uttered these words Come Lord but what more could not be heard. Thus as you had acquaintance of her in her life, you are acquainted with a true relation of her death, that you may rejoyce with her & weepe with me, & that God to whom alone belong the issues of life & death helpe us to glorifie him in either of both conditions.

The motive induceing my pen to scrible these few lines unto you is notoriouse and very urgent to any honest hart at the first riseing of this storme, I had well hoped a strong gale of patience would have blowen it over, and those whisperings thatt are now soe curant amongst you would have beene killed in the shell butt my patience can hold noe longer, and soe you have compelled me if any thing be nott to your compelatary motion thanke your selves and excuse him thatt dare nott now butt acuse you, least guilt of selfe violente should ly upon my selfe: neither have you stayed heare butt soe great Caracters have you written them in, thatt he that runs may read it: and I thatt had thought to have prest my pen for silent service must now stepp forth in a [word illegible] defence to releave my selfe againest your calumniations which now foloweth, I shall sume them up, they are the fo[llowing]\\n That I hold and mentione dangerouse erours, before ignorante people to deceive them, butt if it weare before my match I would be delte with well inough: (and they are these) as that Mr Harrison did well in praying for the woman falen into the scandalous sine of fornication, when shee sent her bill to the congregation also that I mentione thatt it was well done in him to use the word (deare sister) at the buriall of the Romane Catholique that I have medled with one of the cheefest of the Towne which I had best lett aloane, least it be worse for me then I am aware of.\\n That it is become a wonder unto you thatt I am sufered to be in the Towne and nott rather to live with my wife as a man of knowledge.\\n That you wonder thatt mother Renard will sufer me to use her house soe much and will nott reprove me for these things you have amongst you transferred that eternall ministeriall dignitie, atending your owne pastour: (and that unto me undiservedly) in these words (thatt I was more able in in gifts then Mr Harison wish my that he could pray as well as I can doe which I utterly disclaime, thus I have summed by the Cheefe [word illegible] me laine in a succinct way to give you some short answer.\\n For the first obiection I scorne to deceive the simple or to delude the ignorant by overpowering them with knowledg butt bring me before whome you please what ever I have said, I shall nott feare to justifie whatt I said; soe long as I have one drop of blood in my vaines: therefore you utter a dareing falacy againe indesence of Mr Harison praying for the woman I spoke whatt I thought on it, and now doe positively afirme it before whome you please, and to whome you will, that he did well in it and had comitted a great sinne if he had nott prayed for her, therefore I produce these scriptures read them your selfe, It is both commanded and practised as a duty in the word of God as a rule for us to walke by, it is commanded in Math: 5: 44,” Jer: 29: 7° soe it is practised by the people of God also 1 Sam: 12: 19\"\\' very pertinent to the purpose as will appeare if you examine these texts with a curious eie soe to this purpose is that of Steven, Acts 7: 60° these are [word illegible] for the [word illegible] of such a cleare truth as this is soe thatt I hope you will nott deny this seing it carieth maiesty from heaven with it, and I suppose I need nott be ashamed to mentaine the truth, nott onely before weake Christians, but also the strongest that are.\\n Also for his using the word (deare Sister) it was nott unlawfull as I conceive, for first she was a deare sister by creation, we had all one father by creation soe she was a sister, again she was a sister by profession, she professed Jesus Christ, and also she was a sister by Baptisme, sow (as I can prove) she was baptised into the church and as yet never cutt of by noe censure of the church therefore deare sister also she was deare in regard of the sufficiency of the meritt of Christs death that was ofered for the elect, and that unto salutation; for the wicked that soe he might judge them, as psalme 2: 8 verse aske of me and I shall give the the [sic] heathen for thy Inheritance and the out most parts of the earth and thou shalt bruse them with a rod of Iron soe much for that obiection.®\\n The secondeth foloweth I answer for my medleing with great ones, I feare Not to give an account when ever I am Called unto it I that know I may nott curse the king in my chamber, I that know the apostle recons it by far a grand imposture to speake evell of dignities, it weare grosse impietie in me to fall thus grosely, and if you lett me butt have the conceite of an hypocrite in your head, you may well know it is nott the way to gaine creditt to my selfe, butt ndeed I have alwayes beene soe wary of speaking evell of honest dignities that I dare nott entertaine the least irreverent thought and whatt sover our evell envieing Christians doe report, whose glory and practise it is to run prateing from house to house to heare and tell (as I by experience know some) yet what danger soever may come to me I pas nott, because if I doe suffer I canott sufer as a delinquent and lett me speake to you Samuell I hope you will nott believe it, but yet soe far am I from feareing whatt I have said or done that in stead of crying petavi, I rather say facere pesimus” but I hope I shall nott have cause to feare any such tryall I have done with this also. To the third particular I answer it is nott convenient for me to write the reason of my being absent from my wife neither would my sheete containe it yett as you are a Christian and as you are an unquestionable believer in my opinion, I hold my selfe bound to signifie to you thatt it is nott oute of any dislike each of other, we live apart: butt onely for some reasons which if you be curious to know when you and I meet I shall lay them downe to your satisfaction, I hope; and tell me Samuell what hurte have I done in your Towne sure I first know it speake plaine I have prayed for the peace and prosperity of it, whether they have beene answered or noe that must be (for the most of them both to you and me) counsell or at least a secrett not to be [word illegible] I have spent my time if it fell to my lot to doe good not onely to my selfe but others I have undergone many hot thunderbolts amongst you, troubles doe surround me dayly from abroad, and what out with day by contestings and a man of temptations which with sorow I am faine now to boast of unto you own of myne infirmities, and why you would have one sent out of the Towne I know nott I am sory thatt the saints are weary of me for wicked men it is noe nuse to heare there rebylenys both of you and me, and liveing and the dead butt you to be weary of me toucheth me verie much butt noe marvell sometimes I am a burthen to my selfe, and yet if you know any course or way to have me out spare nott however this I canott butt take as an affliction sent of God to weed out some hurt, oh that I may make a hapie use of it soe much for that. For the 4\" thing I have nott much to say to it, it is rather bent upon her (whoe as I have heard since I began this letter) hath beene the [word lost] of this storme, god grant I may make a hapie use of it soe I leave that and her too worse then I though to have done.\\n The last is something worse then the rest, for your comparsisons betweene Mr Harison and my selfe, that I was more able then he for discourse and prayer, I doe nott aprove of it butt doe protest in the presence of God I desire nott for to be accounted neither Doe I believe it to be true in part or in whole, whatt shall I say, I utterly disclaime it I say noe more onely dearely beloved had you seene these faults in me this tard was not the way to reclame me, in whispering behind my backe noe Samuell these rather stur up wrath and envy, and eyell surmises, butt our saviour layes downe another way 6 Gall 1** Math 18\" 15° which course if you take what [word illegible] my time, when you se me fall, lett me nott be [word illegible] then lett the righteous smite me thatt shall be good for me, soe shall nott my head be broken I shall make prayers for you, both now, and ever, while time lasts to me, or I to it and you eternised in the heavens.\\n \\nSoe praieth your unworthy friend\\n\\nJohn Coulton\\n\\nRey May 20\" 1641\\n\\nWhat ever from my pen doeth fall\\n\\nOh lord take thou the glory of all\\n\\nGoodman Coulton\\nI salute you, I perceive I am growne odious in your sight and become very obnoxious to you, by reason of some false accusations & calumnious aspersions cast on me by some that are seeming friends onely. I have now received your Letter, wherein you charge me with divers & severall false positions, at which I marvaile but I pray expect not such a circumspect answer as if I had learned the [words struck out] art to comprehend much matter in a few lines, or as if I had a helper to instruct & teach me, yet thinke not that it shall altogether die in silence when as for what I spoke I know how to answere if I goe awry teach me & I will learne, raise me to understand where in I have erred.\\n First you impute to me, that I should report you hold and maintaine langerous errors before ignorant people &tc. to notifie to you the words that then said in every particular as neere as I can remember (speaking the truth in Christ before whose dreadfull tribunall I must give accompt as of all my words & workes, so of this also whether they be good or evill) were these, that some of your Reasons to uphold praying for the Fornicator, & the words, Deare Sister, at the buriall of the Papist were very weake.\\n And now to insist a little larger on it, you would go about to prove it, you bring me scripture indeed, which as I conceive are nothing correspondent to the purpose, you quote me the precept of Christ & example of Steven, which instances onely praying for our enemies. I conceive there to be two sorts of enemies to be praied for & that after a double manner, the enemies of the Church of God in generall and our owne enemies in particular. For the first sort we are to pray either for their conversion (because we know not whether they belong to God or no) or confusion (as David imprecates in some of his Psalmes against such enemies) & this may be done in the publicke congregation. For our owne particular enemies, we may pray for them generally in the publicke congregation but not particularly, for if any have wronged abused or reviled us, so as it tends to the dishonour of God & scandall of his Gospell, though we are to forgive them in our heart & earnestly pray for their pardon & to qualifie our heat of malice with some affection of love: Yet not to testifie our forgiveness outwardly by praying for them publiquely till such time as they seeke reconciliation & submit themselves lest we confirme the verity of the former & insure the like upon our selves in future times. Now for your place in Jeremy 29.7.” where the prophet exhorts the people of the Jewes, to pray for the peace and prosperity of the city whether they were led captive producing this reason for in the peace of that, they shall have peace. Those words as I perceive are no proofe of the point in hand, when the prophets drift is to teach & divert the people how to undergoe their captivity with the more ease by praying that the city might be at peace freed from trouble & warre & perplexity, for they being there resident, if any such combustions be must be sure to share in them, therefore seeke the prosperity of the city & pray to the Lord for it, that so they might with the more patience & lesse grief waite upon God, for the time of their deliverance, not for any affection that the Prophet beareth to the Tyrant or to the City (which may seeme if you take the words too literally) noe for not onely the Israelites but all the world yea & the very insensible creatures should rejoyce when these Tyrants should be destroyed as we may read Isaiah .14. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. & so forward.* And for that in Samuel, unlesse you will prove the Israelites to be such as she is, is very impertinent, but if it were soe (which is a gross falsity to thinke,) yet its to no purpose for first its a question whether he praied for them in private or in publique, but if he did pray for them in publique, yet they first confess their sinnes & humble them selves openly before him, but you may tell me, so did she in regard she sent to be praied for, but it is apparent to the contrary whatever she seemingly pretends, witness her vile words spoken to one that professt Godlyness, about that time, which though she now deny yet can be justified on oath to the contrary, so that it is cleare she had no love nor liking to the waies of God, neither to humiliation nor prayer but onely to have her sickness removed (which many an honest woman endures more in the common disease of child bearing) it’s true we must judge charitably, but charity judges not absolutely not peremptorily & though it hope well of all things: yet it is not a toole to conclude all things. Again the prophet convicts them of & laies open unto them the hainousness of their sinne & reproves them sharpely & severely for it, & that before he prayes for or at the least manifests his prayer to them which may be plainly seene by viewing the context, which if she had beene (as the manner of some other reformed churches are) I could have held well with. But for to be praied for in the publique congregation before she had testified her humiliation & repentance & before she had beene soundly reproved, I cannot thinke to be lawfull since her fault was so scandalous, lest it were a countenancing of her in it. For the Apostle saith plaine .1.Tim. 5. 20.” them that sinne rebuke openly that the rest may feare, thus much for that.\\n Now for your Reasons to prove the words Deare Sister at the buriall of the Papist to be lawful, I thinke them little lesse than cavills, it’s true, we had all one father by creation, & we are all by nature the children of wrath, but now nature is changed by grace in the godly & old things are passed away, & we are now no more strangers & foreiners but citizens with the saints & houshold of God, and now what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness what communion hath light with darkness? What concord hath Christ with Belial? and what part hath a believer with an Infidell? I leave to the learned to judge.\\n And for her profession, I pray how did she professe Jesus Christ, was it not after a wrong manner? are not all the tenents of the papisticall religion for the most part egregious & pernicious errors, derogatory to the honour & dignity of Christ, and that in a high degree, I presume your selfe can witness, nay she was an Infidell being a papist, for they deny the faith of us Christians & cleave to the covenant of workes which is now abrogated, and no man 1s able to performe neither is any man justified by it. Gal. 3. 11.“° And as I said before what communion or fellowship hath a believer with them? And especially in such a neere bond of relation as to be a Sister or Brother to them by profession. I thinke it little lesse then to partake of their sinnes, wherein we lye lyable to partake of her plagues.\\n And for Baptisme, when she was baptized she knew not what she did, but others were surely for her, which when she came to age, was bound to performe, but refused (violating her covenant she there made & judged her selfe unworthy of eternall life, following dumbe Idolls as she was led) and joyned unto a false church: that the Apostles words might be verified they went out from us for they were not of us, if they had beene of us, they would no doubt have continued with us still. So that Antichristians & Christs followers have no relation nor affinity to or with one another. But you may object, it may be said to them as well as to carnall men living in this Church, I deny it, for they submitting themselves to the ordinances of God (though perhaps church papists) are under the compass of a truc visible church (as farre as I yet see) when as the Papists are of a false church &c. so much for that.\\n Secondly you blame me for saying you meddled with great ones which you had best let alone &c. I protest unto you, I never said it. The words that I said (as neere as I can remember without either addition or detraction) were these: you had discanted on some randome, concerning praying for Maudline, which if you have done, you know, whether they be great one or little ones, if you have not then you may repute me a lying Christian (as well as envying Christ) but I know on what grounds I spake it.\\n For your third it is partly true & partly false. I then spake in the words of the Apostle that you ought to live with your wife as a man of knowledge, which I thinke you cannot take distast at since it was the words of the Holy Ghost, & for your propounding to me the reasons of your living asunder, I desire it not. Thinke not (I pray) that I harbour curiosity so much in me, as to be a meddler in other folkes matters, lest I come under the Apostles reproofe, onely I thinke it occasion of scandall for a professor & his wife to live at variance. For the other part I disclaime it utterly & therefore cannot nor will not Answer for that which I never said nor thought.\\n For the fourth also is partly true & partly false, for the first I said it if I were to live in the house as Goody Kennard is I should not endure, but to reprove you plainly, which was all to my knowledge that I said, wherein I meant plainly & simply as I wish any one would do to me when they see amisse in me. But for the other that she should not suffer you to use her house, it is others slanders and not my words.\\n For your last I have nothing to do with it, neither did I know any word to that effect was spoke till I questioned about it & neither were as you have set them downe, but I wonder why you should burden me with it, seeing you know I spoke it not except by your denying the negative, you would have others prove the affirmative, which I know none meanes to doe. This I hope will give you satisfaction for that I spake, without any further contention, & whereas you reprove me for whispering behind your backe I may justly retort it on your selfe; for I spake it to one of your sociable companions, but you noised it abroad before divers as I had notice, before you knew the truth. Thus craving pardon for my boldness intreating you to make a favourable construction of all my Errors. I commit you to your safest conduct of the surest conductor and so remaine\\n \\nSometime your loved Sometime\\n\\nyour loathed\\n\\nSa: Jeake\\n',\n",

My tenderest Affections are toward you, whom I love as my owne soule, whose happines is my rejoycing, whose griefe is my Dollour, whose victories shall be my crowne, whose societies I judge my selfe unworthy to enjoy, because the Lord hath deprived me of it: & that I feare in anger. I am right glad to heare from you. Your letters did not a little refresh my dropping spirits. Oh how I long to see you! much more to abide with you; that so we have beene comely in our lives, in our deaths we might not have beene divided. & now what adds downe weight to my sorrowe? but that I feare I shall never see your faces more. But the will of the Lord must be done. I know mine iniquities are of such a distracting power that they do not onely sequester my friends but labour to separate my God from me. I have little to write to you, but a last farewell. I can do nothing for you but that which I daily do (to wit) often ply heaven with prayers for your good whose conditions all joyntly & every one severally according to my weake abillity both are & shall be commended to God continually by me. What shall I say? I desire your safe returne againe if the will of the Lord be so. I desire victory for you, against your & the Lords enemies. I desire you may (as I heare you are) be couragious, having so good a cause call & captaine. I desire you may keepe your selves from spiritual pollutions: Babes keepe yourselves from Idolls Amen.” And what you are deprived of in respect of publick Administrations, I desire the Lord by the immediate workings & conveyance of his spirit to make good to you. When you go forward, or shall set upon any attempt what is my desire? but that the Lord would rise up before you & scatter your enemies: and when you rest, that the Lord would returne to the many thousands of Israel. In a word I desire your happiness, & in some respect I could even wish my selfe miserable to attaine my desire. I cannot make an end or give over the multiplication of my soules wishes for your soules & bodies good. I am full of matter, & the spirit within me constraines me to go on; let your love pardon my excesse, it may be the last time that ever you may heare from me, I know not, but might my speech be long as my heart is large, or could it possibly be soe: when should I surcease, these my hartiest benedictions, these my kindest valedictions? Yet I must conquer my selfe & spite of my longing heart to wish longer. Desiring onely this one thing that what good I am not able to intreat God for you, the Lord of his goodness may please freely & fully to give downe upon you all for ever, that so it may come to passe that in all respects & estates what soever wherein you are or may be considered you may in every of them be truly blessed that as men you may be faithfull, as souldiers couragious as Christians gracious, & as Saints glorious, more than these I cannot pray for & I do & will pray that you may never enjoy less from the hands of the living God, who giveth abundantly and upbraideth no man, who sincerely seeketh his face for any present or future favour. And so deare Christians and Brethren, my faithfull & affectionate heart bids you all farewell, you are all beloved of me, & I must now leave you to the love of God, whose power guard you from all evill, grace guide you unto all good, peace rule in your hearts & mercy compasse you about in all estates. As my loving friends I leave you to him that is the helper of the friendlesse. As warriours I leave you to the Lord of Hosts who is the mighty God of battell, as Christians I leave you to Jesus Christ both your Lord and mine. He abide with you, his grace abound in you, his Holy Spirit be your comforter on Earth, your conductor to heaven. And now the God of peace that brought againe from the Dead the Lord Jesus Christ , that great Shephard of the sheepe through the blood of the everlasting covenant make you perfect in every good worke to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever\\n \\nSoe prayeth yours whilst his owne\\n\\nSamuel Jeake\\n',\n",

Your faithfull fellow feeling with the poore oppressed Kingdome, hath hitherto beene manifested in your appearing as a Saviour unto it & your unwearied undertaking for publique good both in former and later actings. You have waded through the Kingdome in blood & carrying your life on the point of your sword have (by the strength of God in you) woone that you weare, & in valour beene victor.\\n Yet it is not unknowne to you that the Kingdome yet groanes (for liberty as Waiting for the manifestacon of the Sonnes of God ) for shall a Nation be borne at once? or in one day delivered from the monstrous Mola’s or conceptions its wombe hath inclosed & hatched these many ages? our miseries were breeding many generations agoe, we must turne over yeares & reignes ere we read their Original, yea runne & rowle beyond the Norman Conquest, & there finde some seeds of our divisions sowne, some men’s wills made laws, some publique persons act to privat ends, & judgment inverted into gall & wormwood, this we know what it meanes by wofull experience our diseases are not of yesterday, they are more desperate than will admit of a tedious cure, & what more bitter! our physicians have beene of no value, our remedies have beene our diseases, he that helped & they that were helpen have both fallen & perished together.\\n But though our freedome be too intricate for man to recuperate yet are we not left either hopeless or helpless, our great Jehovah being engaged to effect it, & for that purpose impower such Actors as majesty from heaven dwells upon, amongst the which your honour challenges the foremost place, the anointing upon you being evidenced by the power with & in you, under whom though but the other day (in the Enemies account) wee were fallen & as dry bones, yet now are Risen & stand upright the tempestuous & thunder threatening cloudes that darkened our Horizon being dispersed through the power of the most High over shaddowing you. Oh loose not the things you have wrought, let there not be a prize in the hand & no heart to improve it, lest we complaine at last the harvest is past, the summer is ended & we are not saved.\\n And though our present grievances have beene more lively represented by others & our petitions begged before for us: yet in the manifold experiences we already have of your unparalel’d endeavours for generall good & our continual confidence of your perseverance therein, reminding your present engagements: we earnestly crave that amongst your midst & multiplicity of your weighty agitations, these our few petitionary proposals may have admission into your serious thoughts, which out of our faithfull affection [word struck out] to your honour & tender care of the weale of the Republique we as humbly & earnestly remonstrating both declare and desire. First that as we do fully adhere to the late Remonstrance & are resolved to venture lives & fortunes in defence of the Army in the just prosecution of it: so doe we desire that no delayes (as conceiving them altogether unsafe) may be admitted therein.\\n 2ly considering that want of care & vigilancy (as well as fidelity) in Comittees & others betrusted with publique affaires hath beene the seminary of many evils to this Kingdome: we intreat that care may be taken to refine them, & that such as shall in any waies be obstructers of justice ether by opposing it, or not improving their intrusted power to that purpose may be excluded & also that the like sedulity may be used in removing the Committee of Accompts & appointing others others in their places they being such whose endeavours are more to ensnare than to advance the publique good. 3ly The Kingdomes groaning under the burden of freequarter & (yet) unreasonable taxes, occasioned by the unfaithfull dealing of those entrusted with the publique treasure: requires (as we humbly conceive) some exquisite search: & those being found that have any way abused the state by such fraudulent practises, as to designe the publique treasure to their private advantage deserve to be severly dealt withall.\\n 4ly minding the nakedness of those marine parts & the great dangers we lie exposed to, if any new commotions (which God forbid) should break forth. We earnestly sue that some carefull provision may be made for the sea coast, & especially neere this place the better to strengthen the hands of the Kingdomes friends, & to prevent (at present) unthought of mischiefs. 5ly Being grieved to heare the slanderous aspersions the Army is & hath beene loaded with, notwithstanding its desert to the contrary: we heartily desire, that all such as shall be knowne to asperse them or to act or speake against their proceedings in reference to the execution of justice & righteousness may be brought to condigne punishment.\\n 6ly The principall Actors in and Abbettors of our miserable differences by reason of prominence in some alliance in others with other such wiseblinding bribes have regained strength to rally againe & againe when we had well hoped were irrecoverable: wherefore we humbly intreat your honour that some commissioners may be appointed to find out the Actors & fomenters of the late warre & bringing in of the Scots & being found to secure them or otherwise, without superficial dealing in matters of this concernment. yet a speciall care to be had of the non oppressing their families.

For I waver in a sea of uncertainty, believing thy selfe can fancie me (or else I should desist.) and not knowing what inferior reasons can counterpoise; but so faine a bloome might have as fertill a harvest. Yet may I not see thee upon any other accoumpt then as a common friend, as the letter didascalizeth, on paine of the forfeiture of my welcome the which though I cannot ceremonize yet I confesse hath exceeded my deserts. If I answer to one objection, [word struck out] another succeeds, and a third dethrones a second & which is more, each reply ingerminates more scruples in thee: yet what should I not endeavour so I might be ascertained of thy love? But to fight still in the aire, amounts to nothing but vapours of victory. And if to satisfy thee I should administer to the deceased & contract for the payment of some long past debts, purchasing to my selfe trouble enough besides an undoubted resurrection of jealousies (if of no more) that I as conscious to my selfe of former fraude (cuius contrarium verum est*) should now administer which I have till now refused: being assured it will nothing else but expose me & through me the Gospell to the vituperie of the world and resurge matters now more than five yeares obliterate and buried, alwaies minding that it cannot adde to my foelicity, nor enfranchise me, either in point of conscience or the law with any cleerer right or title unto what I anjoy than what | already have & enjoy it with: and yet then not to be certaine of acceptation with thee neither, & so to loose the end of my engagement, would but render me ridiculous, if not Bipedum Stultissimus.”° My friend I confesse with thee, the will of God is a resting point for believers, & therefore I cannot say much though my heart be enlarged, yet had need to desire submission to his will & herein implore your helpe.

I appeale to the barre of judgement, let not passion sway the Scepter nor Will bias your Reason: had I exposed your watch by tongue or hand to publique view (which so let me prosper in your favour & the other world) had I thereby now more than formerly merited a finall exclusion a for-ever excommunication out of your favours? easily this crime augmented by a magnifying glasse to the highest aggravation were but veniall, though I doe professe I know not how it should happen for I neither looked upon it nor wound it up, but when alone, unless some[one] saw me invisibly or pict my pocket when asleepe, but if it were granted which I cannot acknowledge unless I bely my selfe, as you in effect are pleased to say I doe though I can bear that very well from your pen innocently, notwithstanding I say is there no absolution for such a mistake or no intercession for such an errour? Is all compassion banish? is every sparke of respect extinct. Be intreated to be a little more tender-hearted for indeed you are in this unlike your selfe. You say my Deare shortest errours are best, and must this be rankt among the most hainous? Alas! Will nothing les satisfy. Could I improve the greatest favour, as much as you the least mistake I should hope to sinke all my fears, split all my doubts and arrive with safety at the desired Haven. But wo is me! If I have a fair gale one day, I am in danger of shipwrecke the next, so unfortunate is my bitter-sweet voyage. But would you not have me think you picke a quarrell on purpose to make a breach of our society, why doe then upbraid me with my fair but you please to stile them false promises and unregarded now for all kindness. My Deare though but for a — extinguisht before the time? Put a Period to this high Career, reflect a little upon your last favour: how doth my heart ake to compare those 2 together! Doe not banish me by a new [word illegible] before the appoynted time, if it must be then be not so tart to your poor supplicant, nor suffer this passion to grow inveterate. Can you delight in cruelty & take pleasure in afflicting your unfeigned but distressed friend & servant doe not make the worst of every thing, nor conclude of betraying worst part if any were betwixt us, because your watch hath sounded so loud. I would with all me soule I had never desired to keepe it. I beseech you pardon the penitent, & Remember the good old rule doe as you would be done unto, and sound a Retreat to this first charge, yea renew again my Deare Love the League already made, & grant me the sight of your face again with comfort that I may inioy some part of my late & sweet felicity, if you please to honour me with a line or 2 before I see you I hope ‘twill a little revive my drooping heart unfeignedly God knows devoted to you, and wishing your welfare every way equall with my owne yea & shall pray for your prosperity though you procure my sorrow of heart. The God of all flesh deale with me according to the integrity of my heart towards you and make up this breach betwixt your selfe and, him that loves you as himselfe, though now accounted unworthy your favour, yet cannot crafe to be indeed what his pen can subscribe to wit\\n \\nMy Deare Love\\n\\nYour faithfull friend & servant\\n\\nand intire Lover (though know\\n\\nunworthy of your favour),\\n\\nRichard Hartshorne.\\n\\nWhat intelligence so ever you had that told you I had your watch, is nothing,\\n\\nno nothing at all but imagination to pump you, for there’s neither a man nor\\n\\nwoman upon earth that hath either seen it or heard so much from my mouth\\n\\nsave your selfe, I wish with all my heart that you doe not or have not ere this\\n\\ncomes to hand, comfort and then tis well enough.

Prithee my Deare if my love deserue any thing, let me know where thou art, how thou dost, and when I may comfort my languishing and sorrowful heart with hopes to see thee thou never wentest away from me so, but wouldest tell me some time of returne. For my part I take God to witness I am very restles, discontented and cannot tell by what means to injoy any thing of my selfe without thee. I know not and that grieves mee whether this will come to thy hand, if it doenot what shall I doe, oh that I might injoy thee one night instead of every nights dreames on thee. I confes I live a most wretched comfortless solitary and indeed heartles life. Oh that my heart should have such a fresh spring of love, so lasting, and so coming after its deare Jewell & not decay! Truly it makes me astonished and amazed at my selfe. I could (but that experience too sadly convincedth me) have believed it impossible love could after so many sharp incourters, so many grand repulses, remaine unconquered imperfection of it first springing. But God knows I know not any thing thou canst doe to me, or against me, can subdue it. It hath been used too barbarously and heathenishly, yet it is not offended, & that addeth to my misery. My love me thinks tis too unnaturall to render contempt for love, slighting for a deare affection. Thou know it how boundless my love hath been, how unfeigned I need not here rehearse, and how durable the weariness of my many & great repulses too much to testify. Is there noe reward for vertue? Is there no jewell transparent but gold? Ah my Dear Heart consider how many have been ruined by breaking their engaged faith & promise there isa time for every thing and certainly if thou wast afraid of God’s Judgements in poor Mr Harding’s case I know not how it can be otherwise, may I believe tis much worse in mine: for I suppose he might in proces of time have married another, I must not. Thou wouldst be accounted iust in thy dealing, I pray God give thee a heart to be so to me but yet I believe never poor lover had more iniury and harder dealing than I have. Good my Dear Heart think upon me, and consider what I suffer for thy sake, poise the burden that lies on my heart but in thy thoughts, make but my case thine a little & weigh it in equity and doe not let all my life be spent in sorrows, and all comforts taken from me att all my Daies. I would I could but send thee one of my present bitter groanes or that thou mightest but for the twinkling of an eye feel my aking heart, surely thy closed nature could not but relent and a little dissolve from its frozen hardnes. The God of Heaven mollify thy hard hart and make it more naturall and not so stony to me. I know thou expectest mercy at Gods hands (which I pray God grant in the hour at death & day of Judgement) but how canst though looke for any & exercise so much cruelty and falseness. Indeed if there were not another world it would not at all matter what our actions were, but my Love there will be atime of searching all the secrets of our hearts, no covers nor pretences can cloake us from the all seeing eye of God. Didst thou ever read or canst thou believe faithless & merciles shall find mercy without repentance or amendment? Thous hast separated mee from the society of men & from thy presence I must be excluded. What heart is able to beare and endure these, this hard measure and not complain? Or who can undergo so great a punishment. Where poor Mr Harding had one trouble I must have 20. The God of heaven some way put an end to my wretchedness or my life or some way helpe me. I am not able to sustaine this cruelty. Poor I that want nothing can be laid to my charge, but that I am not borne toa great inheritance, that only abound in love and poverty, the last [word lost] the former filthy and of noe beauty. A better fortune [may] make a lesser love far more worthy in thy eyes, have a better lustere though never to good a relish. I waited a Saturday [to see] poor little Bab but when I consider her parting from mee [words lost] it even makes me curse the day of my birth & the hour when it was said a son is borne. She cald moda, moda, moda* {words lost] shall not do away! Truly I am not satisfied at her [word lost] though I found the old woman having her on her knee, but the house is old & the roofe is much unthatcht and open to the cold & raine. Good dear heart therefore take some care of thy deare babe she yet complains of her poor belly, but is merryish & something chearfull [words illegible] a teach as well as she can speake, & I beseech & conjured thee to returne home again thy business being dispatcht that was undertaken and make noe quivocations with my poor heart, nor delaies to take care of thy dear Image. I would to god either time or sorrow would cut the thred of my dismall dayes, or consummate the ioys & desires of my too much abjured though yet valient heart, No more now.\\n \\nFrom that hand whose guide\\n\\nis clouded with tears to thinke\\n\\nof thy cruelty, yet must ever be\\n\\nthine till he be not\\n\\nRichard Hartshorne,\\n\\nFor my much honoured and very good friend Mrs Barbara Harding, these in\\n\\nLondon\\n',\n",

       "  'TEXT': '[25] Richard Hartshorne to Barbara Harding (previously Holman), undated. Original letter. \\nESRO FRE 5270\\n\\nMy Hard Deare Heart\\nI have received thy deare & bitter lines, would to God they were not so deare to mee, then should I not meake and worthless, naked and unarmed be continually necessitated to assault an invincible Castle fortified with stone walls, harder than Adament stronger than marble through which there is noe gate, noentrance, so high, no accesse, nay and which is far worse, might be betrayed with gold, cannot be won with virtue. Wilt thou never assuage this scorching flame? Hast thou only added fewell to make a sacrifice? If it were ligated what more comfortable? continually fed, what more cruell? Oh that I had any thing but bitterness, teares, & a broken heart to send thee: I would I had the treasures of the Indians to make access for my Petition or the fortune of ten thousand [words illegible] than I for my succes. But thou hast only loved mee to make me miserable, a by-word and a spectacle which my misery too sadly proves, wert thou not mine by the comfort of thy fond dear Heart (how often given I shall not say) I would ingeniously acknowledge my importunity presumption and more then [word illegible] but what is freer then gifts? or what can be more mine owne then what is freely given? Nay and if thou avert not that inestimable Pearle farre above the worth of this faire world. I should not account thee worth my seeking. but alas my dull pen cannot describe thy Deare value that my forlorne and dying heart hath put upon thee. If I had only Complements to devise my fancy might be undervalued by its invention but I have nothing but faithlessnes & broken promises to breake my broken heart. Oh that it might be broken at once for all, that I might once put an end to my grevious & just complaint! Could I have found any meanes to quench this burning flame, I would not send to thee who wilt rather suffer my to dye for thirst then give a drop of water to coole my scorched heart. If thou enduredst such a captivity so cruel a prison, so bad companions, and with all soe continually inbittered with most exquisite Torment thou wouldst thinke it were more then barbarous, more cruel then heathenish, more savage then bestiall. but I, poor I, have lost my Reason, the guide of my life, my liberty, the inioyment of my selfe, my hopes, the comfort of my beeing, what have then I left but a life not worth the name. I am sure death is a thousand times more acceptable to mee then anything I enioy.\\n If others covet thee, thou art pleased to say thou wilt not forget what is betwixt thy selfe & me, alas, if thou deny them, am I any better than they? And have not they as much as I nay more they are at liberty, so am not I, they may make a new choice, so cannot I, they may have many, I must not have one, mine owne. Surely thy thoughts are very bad of mee and thy love very small to mee to say I may make a new choyce when thou knowest I am bound under an eternall course to marry none but thy deare selfe. It is not a wife, nor a woman that I so much dote upon a tis none but thee who to me art the quintessence of all thy sexe, who though thou art so cruell wouldst give my soule to Hell, God I hope will have more mercy for it. But why (if it be lawfull to expostulate) didst thou urge me to engage my selfe by tongue, who was thy own in heart long before and told thee I rather desired to doe it my [word illegible] as thou knowest to this day, and now thus to sleight all my love, to eat up all thy promises in effect, and pretend to give me my liberty againe prithe tell me, can a man hanged dead have his life restored? but be it soe, twas thy will. I satisfied it and it had satisfied mee had it been the same as I have been, had it been true as I have been to the swearing away of my life, my misery will never redound to thy honour, nor the breach of thy promises make thee happy. For I beseech thee consider thy dealing with me, than knowest none hath above one heart (but thy selfe) how long thou hast had 2 thou art not ignorant, doe but tell me then with what I shall love another woman? Besides have I had so good success that if I were at liberty I could hope to be more fortunate. God blesse me till then and not longer. But alas my Dear Heart tis nothing for thee to bid one leaden to run that cannot go. I am sure thou wast pleased in thy deare arms to call me husband, before I durst dare to honour my selfe with the name of wife. But I perceive thy [word illegible] is apart of thy selfe subject to forget what it loves not, & very to continue in the contrary. I visit thy Dear Bab last Saturday that I might kisse mine owne. Why dost thou tell me thou canst not satisfy my Love God hath made thee willing, there wants nothing but performance. Thou toldst me thou marriedst twice against thy will why not a third time to thy poor friend? See if thou canst perswade thy hard heart a little to relent and with mee I beg of as for my life a faster hand since (my heart) thou thinkst I deserve thee for my love before the God of Heaven conscious of my love & thy promises I beg, beg & beseech thee let me be once rewarded with that treasure which I am devoted to serve and honour to the breathing out of my last gasps, which if this may not be I pray the God of Heaven put an end to my long lingering sorrowes & give thee peace and forgive thy hard dealing to\\n \\nThy Poor distressed but ever\\n\\nLoyall servant\\n\\nRichard Hartshorne\\n\\nThese for my dear but unkind Mrs Barbara Harding\\n',\n",

These, indeed, thankfully arrived. For I feared that either my or your previous letters had perished on the way. May favour be present with health, and I cordially desire for you the same mercy, But if I shall ever have been ill, I will most speedily send you word, {and] I pray that in this case, may it be far from me to neglect or scorn your love. Such thoughts had never entered into my mind, nor (by God’s grace) will they enter. I have heard no word of the plague since the arrival of Thomas Shoosmith. I have seen a bill of mortality in which none died of the plague. Although the bill does not engender much faith, I heard from D. Martin (with Thomas Shoosmith present) that two had died. Today I asked uncle; he did not swear that a boy died in this parish when Thomas Shoosmith was accompanying me. After this I have heard nothing. Aunt is waiting for Mary Key, who has now recovered. Uncle also greets you. My cousin is well. I bought Buxton’s Treasury of Volsius’ Rhetoric concerning the size of the kernel of Amosius, 559 pages, and John Bulwer’s Pathomyatomia, a small octavo, 240 pages, and 6s. 6d. I set out for D. Gingey and spoke to his wife. She said that if I send a bill of sale, this would be payment for a thirtieth part of a ship. I handed over the letter to Mr Boys. He will send you a reply. I have received £10 from Mr Boucker; I have seen M. W. Stedd at whose instruction I have released £10 to his servant, [and] introduced the receiver of his letter. I saw Mr Allin. Friendly greetings to T. Shoosmith, with [his] mother etc. Lask your prayers as well for my soul as for my body; I remain desirous of hearing of your safety; I have written very hurriedly.\\n \\nYour most obedient son\\n\\nSamuel Jeake junior\\n',\n",

If you can get some candied cowslips or conserve of them you may buy some and eate in a morning before breakfast they are good for your head. I suppose you have heard that Henry Man is lost coming from Diepe on the 24\" of October last but how none of them in the vessel lived to tell, nor where can yet be discovered. Your calls you wrot me in your former from heaven are to be harkened to & so farre from grounds of discouragment that they provoke to runn the faster, God hath not yet done calling. Behold now is the acceptable time, & this the day of salvation, to day therefore heare his voice, get a true sight of sinne & a hatred of it & holy purposes & earnest prayers against it & although an answer come not presently yet every delay is not a deniall God will come & tarry not. Looke into the freeness of grace in the Gospell tendered to unworthy soules, thiefe sinners &c. who have no money or prize in their hands to buy or purchase & if you can do no more yet hope, and wait for God hath promised to be gracious to the soule that waiteth for him he knows our strength & remembers that we are but dust & he will not contend for ever, we are not choise of mercy because we believe are holy &c but because we should believe & be holy being chosen thereunto. In all with Gods free grace and Christs free laying downe his life even when we were enemies do sufficiently demonstrate our inability & insufficiencie to procure merit purchase worke out or deserve our owne salvation & if so why should you or any other that is sensible of sinne & brought into a longing after & loving of Jesus Christ thinke your selves excluded. Where hath God excluded any that are become willing to be divorced from their sinnes and married to their saviour? That God hath touched your heart is good, that he will heal it as well as wound it I doubt not, & if he hide his face some time he will after two daies revive & you shall live in his sight.

Aunt asks me to write to you whether you have sent us her gown, which she left behind at Rye, or not, and by whom you have sent it. I have seen Mr White and received from him a pledge of your love; thank you for this. I have received by the hand of Mark Chiswell from Mr Salter £3. Greet T. Shoosmith with [his] mother, etc. I have no more business, but I have not received a letter from you this week. \\nFarewell, desirous of your health,\\n\\nYour most obedient son\\n\\nSamuel Jeake junior\\n',\n",

The money he could not pay me (he said) when I spake to him which was May 30\" because he had not so much in the house, but hath promised I shall without faile have it next Thursday morning. I could not get him to deduct any thing for his charge. Yours of May 28\" I received May 31° and the same day presented the bill, was ordered to come for the money this day morning. I went but Mr Norton hath put me off till the afternoon & then he promised I shall have it. I could not get above £3 10s for the Rings & 5s for the spoon. The money I have received for the Rings, & hope to have of Mr Langley, with what | brought up will serve to pay off my Aunts accompt of £15 17s 10 ‘Ad & to serve my owne occasions & something over. I had wrote you how the price of Turky work cushions & carpets was but that my Aunt mistook & enquired for chairs & goeth not out again till to morrow. I heard yesterday by Mr Byndlos that he saw a Letter for me at the Posthouse but I cannot light upon it nor hear of it since nor what is become of it & therefore cannot understand whether you have ordered me any other business or no, for mine is now finished so as to come away upon a days warning. As for news J cannot write you so certain as I judge you have already, for reports are to this day infinitely various, howbeit tis certain that the hospitalls are very full of wounded men.” Here is not yet any danger of pressing if there be I shall be very carefull of my selfe nevertheless I would not care how soon I were at home. If there be any presse I will not lye at my Aunt’s:* If you please to speak to the Carrier to bring me up a horse next week that I may have him next Thursday come sevennight in the morning. I shall God willing be at Tunbridg the same night, I am not willing to stay any longer. I intend to lodge there at Petly’s at the signe of the Bull.

Assumed draft letter. \\nESRO FRE 4868\\n\\nRye May 14\" 1678\\n\\nRespected Cousin\\nBy yours of the 23\" past I have to satisfaction your full answer to my former since which I have communicated my intentions to those that will be interested with me with such goods as I shall send for from Ireland to London whose names you have at foot: and having last post received advise from London that Excha[nge] continues good for Ireland, with an accompt of the present price of Irish tallow in London being at £37 per Ton. We have concluded that though it be not the best time of yeare to buy in Ireland yet to try now with a small parcell that if it please God to give success with it may be preparatory to a greater quantity after Michaelmas. And therefore I do hereby order you to buy for my selfe & Company 4 Tonnes of good Tallow at the best rates the present market with you will affoord. In your Choice whereof do as for your selfe that it may be good white & well tryned into the Cask & such as is fitt for London market & be pleased when bought to ship the same in the first good English vessel bound for London marked Mo & consigned to Mr Jn° Mackley Tallow chandler in Tooleys Street neer London bridge in Southwark, London. Pray but+t let it be in great Cask or 5. 6. & 7. hundr with the Cask which saves us something at the Customehouse in the tare. And for the cost please to draw on me & Company at the usuall time of payment payable in the house of the said Jo: Mackley London for which you may take the best Excha[nge] that presents to my advantage. I should have remitted but that it would have been impossible to have fitted the money exactly & this being only for a Tryal we know not how our Resolutions will be to continue the trade. I hope the profit of Excha[nge] may not be much less to us for being drawn on. Moneys were remitted from London last week to Dublin at 10 per % profit. Pray put the order hereby given you in Execution with all convenient speed & without hesitation. I have fully considered of the suspences and demurr on Trade you write of & fear not that hazard you mention. Let not uncertain Rumors delay your following my order, I think the Excha[nge] can never be better for me [words struck out] My partners are Mr Tho: Miller & Mr Rich Freebody of Rye & the said Mr John Mackley to which last consign the goods as above & send the bill of Lading but the invoice enclose in yours to me. My Father & selfe are through mercy in health & presenting your selfe with our respects & congratulations of your mutual happiness. Expecting your answer ar first I remaine\\n \\nSir Your most affectionate Cousin\\n\\n& most faithful humble servant\\n\\nSa: Jeake jun\\n',\n",

We see but one way to doe any good which in short is if you see any likelihood of buying a lesser quantity as of 200 or 150 or if not above 120 quarters Winchester, & can be certain to fit freight a vessell to what you buy it & freight her from Padstow to Rye with it for 2s the Winch[ester] quarter or thereabouts; If you judge it to be effected and could for a beginning buy SO quarters or more of good wheat at 12 or 13 your bushel of 21 gallons as you write the price it was then its possible you might pick up enough in smaller parcells to freight a small vessell provided you can have one in your Port. And we should be content to advance to 14 your bushel if the cargo might be made up at different prizes not exceeding that. If you have any prospect of accomplishment it will be requisite to be very diligent & speedy & yet to do it without clamour, if you could make a beginning & buy some indiff[erent] parcells of the principal farms we hope the rest might comply & not advance much. We cannot allow more time for the buying & shipping it then a month after the receipt of this Letter. So if you can effect it as above you must not lose any time but fall to buying immediately with what privacy you can, And for moneys draw on Mr Walter Monkeat at the Goate in Lothbury London. Your bills shall be well paid, And if you fraight a vessell must agree with the master to stay 14 days at Rye & if you can get him under 2s per quarter Winch[ester] but for a small matter we must not stand. We desire your answer per first & if you proceed then every post or two as the business goes forward. But if you see that neither such a quantity can be bought nor a vessell hired at Padstow then pray desist altogether & only favour us with a Line of answer.\\n ',\n",

But if he bea substantiall man & no danger of his breaking or Running away, I think it [words struck out] might be as well to bring your action against him for non Payment of the Bill, & not before or to make an attachment, then if you can as well have opportunity then to doe it.

As for beaff also he hath allowed him Bread & Beere which is more than was allowed me when I was a Clerk, He hath constantly hot meat for dinner & bread & butter or cheese for supper which is as much as I allow my own children, & the course I have always observed in house-keeping, which was never so traduced (as I know of till now) till this done by your son, His Ribaldry I complain off is down right bawdry, no man I beleeve can think me so [word lost] or ridiculous to accuse him for such things for asking for Victualls only, besides he was generally doing mischiefe (whereof I have severall instances) to the goods in & about my house. And though catched in the Act yet did as impudently deny all as he doe to you his ribaldry, for your sake I am willing to trye him a little longer hopeing his Amendment, which if he doth not we shall not continue long togather, And as for the Termes if he should persist in his impudence & by Acting & writeing lyes endeavour to expose me, that shall be settled by indifferent persons. But if he wants Victualls (as I understand he hast writ to you he does) I suppose you'll be ready to remove him, which you may so soon as you please with all my heart, And in that case alsoe the same Method shall if you think fit be used to adjust what shall be returned, I am very sincere in what I now write, & should be loath to say more (though I could inlarge very much in this matter) seeing my credit must be brought in competition with your sons (according as he boasts himselfe) [words struck out] In your not believing anything against him, notwithstanding which I am Madam\\n \\nyour humble servant\\n\\nRichard Goodenough.\\n\",\n",

The letter also refers to Elizabeth Jeake’s great belly, a term that was not necessarily confined to the latter stages of pregnancy. Elizabeth would have been around 5 and half months pregnant with her first child in August 1682. For examples of the use of the term ‘great belly’ see Laura Gowing, Common Bodies: Women, Touch and Power in Seventeenth-Century England (New Haven, 2003), 148. ',\n",

But this poor man hath never seen him since, and the person hath been to demand the money of him, and the Bayleys lye in wait to take him, that he is faine to keep within doors and dares not stirr out for fear of being sent to prison. I would have had him write down to his Mother but he was very earnest with me to write because he said he feared that his [word struck out] writing would not be understood, which seeing the man in so much distress I promised him to write to you, that you might acquaint Coz Hartshorne with it and if it is thought convenient may order that the money [words struck out] may be paid for I believe if he were in prison he is not able to procure tenn shillings for his reliefe, and now is not in a capacity to follow his own concernes, I went this morning to inquire for this Stead att Staples inn but he went out of town yesterday that I could give you no better account than what I had from Clerk who made such a sad complaint to me that I much commiserated the man’s condition and thought my self in confidence bound to signify to you what I have that the poor man may be in a capacity to follow his imploy and therefore hope you will resolve this trouble.

I answered your Queries and gave you an accompt of my paine that then continued from f° to O™ since which through mercy my paines are abated though some Remnants remain, what the issue of these often visits from heaven may produce at last you may see & prepare to see me no more, Though your desires & filial affections (of which I never doubted) should be denied they shall have paternal reciprocations. Yet I know nothing but if God spare me life & the apsects from above be more propitious I may see Rye. If in my absence I shall find my life in jeopardy I shall be willing you have timely notice that I may set mine eyes upon you before I dye & you may put your hands upon mine when dying. God allmighty bless you, your wife & issue he shall give you and give me your society in heaven though I should have no more of it on earth, which would be as acceptable to me as you, And whether our Iniquities as well as the Iniquities of the times have not been conjunct to the accomplishment of this present dispensation may be considered by us distinctly or whether I only have eaten the soure grapes though your teeth are set on edge. But what ever the cause on earth hath been I am sure the cure is in heaven. I am willing to look thither & should I look any where else can see nothing from men, means, policy, power, care contrivance or such like that may render [word illegible] of help to the distresses, disruptions distractions, fears, snares trials &c of the sons & daughters of Zion. I am sometimes ready to fear in stead of my coming to Rye you will be forced from thence, And bless God you have yet been able to bear up against the storm & desire if it be his will you may dwell quietly under your own vine. I am not without hopes that in measure God will meet this storm now it is shot forth & debate with it & stay his rough wind. But if otherwise let all go rather than Christ and a good conscience.

Though she is troubled because her son Nath: comes not at her. As to the outlaw which you mention Mr Knight informed Mr Shinner of would come out against me next terme, I think it will be to no purpose to throw away 30s to keep it of fora .12. moneth seeing if that on the Oxford Act” be stopt, it will be no stop to the Capias upon the Excommunication but I may as well be taken upon that & sent to prison as upon the other, so I yet am resolved to rest on providence & let the Lord do with me as seemeth good in his sight. This no little refreshment to me and a great mercy to you to heare you are yet spared from prosecution, which if you should I doubt you must be forced to come away. As long as you are not prosecuted the Books may remain as they are But if there be any thing else that was mine which you can spare you may sell & put into money. The Great Table & Stools you may sell if you can get 40s though it be worth more. Or any thing else you have a mind to sell. The parcell of Books you mention that stood upon the shelf under the great map neere the window if you send me a catalogue I may see what I can get for them. I have informed Cosin Mackley what you write concerning him, Cosins & kindred here are well & remember to you. Remember my kind love to all my friends with you as if named. On the 5\" instant I received a Letter from Mr Markwick date Apr .2. wherein he informs me that by the vigillancy of the Adversary he thinks you will not be able to gaine any opportunity to meet with more then 5. above the family. And would have my thoughts on that. Touching which the Lord direct you for I cannot. But if you cannot meet otherwise to enjoy any season of joyning your forces to send up your petitions to heaven without distraction you were better meet with that number then not att all. If the Lord deprive or suffer the Adversaries rather to deprive you of your solemne Assemblies, the sin will be the enemies, the suffering yours. I do not think the loss or deprivation of some ordinances will separate God & his people, seeing he was with the congregation in the wilderness when they wanted circumcision & the Passover & at first had no settled priesthood or ministry among them. If you did take some weeke day to set apart & seek God in the case and make it a Particualr request [words struck out] whether to meet with 5. or more as you have done & run the risque of it. [two lines struck out] The God of Jacob be your refuge, & put underneath you his everlasting Arms, make your enemies that promise to themselves great things Liars & make you to tread on their high places. If there by any worth or strength in my prayers you may all be sure you shall not want them, & perswade my self I have a share in yours & if I knew when you would set apart any time to seek God as above | would let my spirit be present with you & send up one sigh & groane for you. I can send you no news, sometime a talk of a Parliament, sometime none. Things are in the City much as when Mr Markwick was here, only is it expected a great many will be excommunicate for not receiving the sacraments at Easter or the next Lords day according to the order of the B. of London.

The information of Mr Miller touching Mr Wares his house at Winchelseas I suppose was misunderstood & referred to the house Mr Wares lived in, which an heire of one Purfield claimed & got from him, and not to this house which he bought of Mr Wats of Appledore, the writings for which I made and they were left in my custody & were in the upper drawer of the court cupboard when I came away from Rye you may nevertheless enquire concerning it of some Winchelsea man. As to Mrs Greenwoods land I think I wrot you before how Robert Brown might write to her son Mr Daniel Greenwood in Oxford in Brasenose Colledge if he had any desire to deale for the land. As to the case of W™ Eaton if he & his wife have levied a Fine of his lands to the use of such persons and their heires exended &c as he shall mortgage grant &c then is the Freehold in Abeyance and shall subsequently follow such uses as he shall appoint. And after the terme is done a mortgage may be made from him (in which his wife need be no party nor is it convenient she should) but the party to whom they levied the Fine may be a party (& if by the Indenture leading the uses of Fine there be any to serve for his consent to such disposal must be a party) otherwise the mortgage to run as usual, & so far as I see by the expression of the uses in your Letter need be no party but the mortgage may be made only from W™ Eaton who had the sole power to dispose, nor need there any mention of the Fine in the mortgage, but it will be meet the mortgage have the part of the Indenture that leads the uses of the Fine left in his custody. Mr Drinkers mortgage I was paid for but whether it lye in the upper drawer of the court cupboard or in the little Box under the little Table, or in one of the Boxes between the little Table & the north wall I remember not. The Accompt of Mr Samson and Mr Holman touching Richard Youngs two children I were not paid for. You may take for them what you think reasonable I had not much trouble to write them. The Ryot charged on Sheriff Pilkington, Shute and severall others™ was found against them last saterday at which tryal it is said the L. C. J. carried himself some passionately yet it is thought is not very easie in his place and either his dismission or resignation is expected. Yet since the trial a writ of Error is granted. Prince George the K of Denmarkes brother is expected shortly to came over & marry the Duke of Y daughter Anne, and tis said will be made Duke of Cumberland.” Some talk yet continues of a parliament about Michaelmas next. Sir Patience Ward is charged with perjury in his deposition at the tryal of the Scandalum Magnatum against Y & to come to his tryal they say next saterday.” The Argument for the Hartfordshire men upon the stat of the 23th of Eliz is to be argued too morrow it is thought the Judges will declare against the dissenters thereupon though yet that court hath shuffled off their judgment thereon openly in court so far as I hear what ever their particular opinions have been in private.

Before your letter I heard this weeke by Mr Skeets that widow Girdler was dead but the bond you mention she left not with me, when Mr Shamel and Mr Gibbons was with her at the house she had the bond there but carried it away with her againe. They desired her she would leave it with some body that in case she should dye might deliver the bond in which she promised she would but into whose hands she intended then to put it she mentioned not, nor when she was last with me at Rye did I see it. I had no more of hers to dispose of then the £6 which was lent Mr Padiham and the Bill for the same lay in her bag with the {words struck out] Paper wherein I had set down what I had paid her & received for her. When you write to Mr Curteis remember my love to him. I am sorry for your loss of Mr Tho: Crouch® who I doubt not but hath gained by his death, being gone where the wicked cease from troubling & the weary be at rest. I pitty his poore cosins of whom he took care, the Lord provide for them. I thinke no man can put downe any house to lay another open but he must make up the breach or else an Action of the case lies against him at the suite of the Owner of the house so dammified. As to the monies you have put out or remaining by you I shall as yet draw none from you till I see more. Things are bad enough yet.

Sir Patience Ward by the jury convict of perjury for words in his evidence at Pilkingtons trial though in his evidence delivered himself so warily as to the best of his remembrance, he heard no such words spoken by Mr Pilkington, not positive but reserving himself to his memory. Some say he is gone since. Other talke of designes against others. L C J. Sanders” is so ill it’s thought he will not be able to officiate next terme.

Your Mother remembers to you & your wife & desired me to write you that Capt Eve hath failed to see her or give her other security here so she would have you write to him by some body that goes to Adlington Court next weeke, and to tell your wife that the things she wrote to her in the letter she this day received she cannot buy, it coming but now to her hands & she intending to come away Monday morning next by the Tunbridge coach. Dr Stacey last time I saw him ordered me when I wrote to you to remember him to you [words struck out]. The Most High bless, keepe and be all in all to you for ever.

I have little to write to you only the opportunity of conveyance by Mr Gillart hath put the pen in my hand. Stand fast in the Faith & having brought the truth sell it not. Be thankfull for what monies you have, put your trust only in the Lord and feare not. Let not the example of any that relapse stagger you. Nothing venture, nothing have is an old saying & may be verified in a Christians adventures for God. They that sow sparingly shall reape sparingly. I had rather see you a Martyr than an Apostate. None ever yet was a looser by Gods service, set your eye on the joy before you & endure the contradictions of sinners, [word illegible] the cross, contemne the world, Rejoyce under Temptation, Trials, Afflictions &c. Let the joy of the Lord be your strength. I have no greater joy in the Earth then to see you walke in the truth, as you have received a commandment from the father. The end will crown your work, fight the good fight of faith, lay hold of eternal life, press through discouragement to the price of the high calling of God in Christ, yet a little while & you shall not see him but againe a little while & you shall see him. Endeavour after more love to God & joy in him that none of his commandments may be grievous. Be instant in prayer, often in meditation. Trust not in uncertain riches, Avoid all distrustfull and distracting cares. Delight yourself in the Lord & he shall give you your hearts desires. The God of all grace stablish strengthen & perfect you, bless you & all yours make you a seed of the blessed of the Lord & your offspring with you.

Original letter. \\nESRO FRE 5292”\\n\\nHonoured Mother,\\nI were last week to see you but you would not be seen so I went away againe and Saterday night I went downe to Gravesend to see what might be done there and there I found a Quaker that was going to Bardeaux and he would not carry me under £7 so that I were forced to come home againe to London for I considered that I know not what I should do then without either Money, friends, acquanitance nor Creditt for if I had some money to carry me to Parris and keepe me 2 or 3 Months till I could get acquainted to helpe me into some manner of employment if it would maintaine me in any manner of meane [word struck out] condition I could by degrees improve my selfe to live better. It is very strange to me to consider that you can in the least Imagine me safe here when I am dayly sought after and alwaies driven out from place to place in such a hazzardous wayes as perhaps you cannot believe. I were in Yorke buildings with Mr Bulger where we were surprised about | a clock at night with a search of 2 or 300 men so that we were both forced naked as we were out on the Topp of the house and if it had not beene for the pittifullness of some of the gentry that let us into their Garretts we had beene both taken. They shott their guns at us as we were on the houses but missed us. This is the Second escape from thence. Mother do but do as my Brother advised you to that is use your reason and you will do well enough but as you do now I am sure you do not. In the first place can you Imagine me safe in England and in the next place can believe that £10 will carry me to France. [word illegible] | have none Periwiggs I have none nor any sort of linen but just to my backe now nor shoes nor boots nor any thing that is fit or necessary for such a journey. Mother if you do but think on these things impartially you cannot but find your the errours of your judgement not to be small in this case. I have no horse neither. Pray send a letter by this Porter and tell me your mind as short as you can whether you had rather see me hanged than [word illegible] alive and in a good condition in another countrey. Consult what I have written here whether this is not very reasonable [word illegible] best be with my Brother whom I doubt not but you will believe when I were in Prison you grudged that charge but would not remedy it by getting me a Pardon or [word illegible] and now I have done it without your knowledge or helpe only by good natured strangers to whom I owe my life for their kindness to get me a Pardon you would not, as you said to backe me you would not because you dared not for feare should run away now I were told by your selfe as well as others that you would straighten your self and lay down so far as £200 would go all what I have saved as well as the other charge for before I could have beene cleared. If I had escaped hanging it would in all things have cost you between £50 or 60 thou you proposed to comply and compound that would have cost you £100 or more with charges and now for one quarter of the money that it would have cost you for my Pardon I can in all probability save my life by going beyond sea and for you to strike out and [word illegible] me that seems to not that you never designed my good or preservation because the sum is so much less than what you said you would give for my Pardon which I must needs [word illegible] if I should be taken but I hope to save that for I very much doubt and have a great deal of reason to believe that I should have no Pardon since my life is not worth £50 there hath beene a horse lost that there hath beene more proferred to find him than you are now willing to give for my life. Suppose that I were taken to night as God knows whether I shall or no I have little reason to beleive that if I should have a Pardon if £50 would buy it but I dare be positive that £500 would not, for you proferred to go as farr as £200 but I do am forced to believe you did but flatter me because in the first place you proffered it in the next place that when you saw it might be had you would not performe it all this treates jelousy in me to thinke you never designed to save my life and now in a manner convinces me that you had rather I should be hanged than not. People that were absolutely strangers to me that might have £100 rather than faile £200 and want bread besides where I lye will not betray my life but would rather go to Goale, severall that have [words struck out] beene brought upon their Oathes (who are strangers to me) to know where I were or whether they did not bring Tooles to bring me out though they really did it and had a reward put in their hands of 30 guineas to discover me refused both and also did their soules so much injury as to sweare falsely. I have no freind in the whole world now I see plainely what I never mistrusted nor would have believed if 10000 men had sworn that you had lay downe £50 for my life but this looks very suspitious. Perhapps you may do do as you do with the Imagination that I have other friends that will do any thing for me but believe me I speake it from my soul and desire never to escape this trouble I am in if I know any one in this world that will give me £20 to save my life sure [you] cannot thinke that if I had so much money as I do here desire which is but £40 in all that I would be so greate a sott and seeke my owne Ruine so apparently as to stay in England in so much visible danger of my life which is as sweete to me as yours is to loose you if you this kepe. Pray put the money into any bodies hands you can trust and let them not give me a penny till I am aboard and going off, if I should go to France as Iam without money friend acquaintance or Creditt I must be forced to steale and there I should be starved in Gaole and hanged at last, Mr Bulger whose father spent more than £1000 to get him a pardon and ruined him selfe to do that is come to see his son and had but £12 in all the world hath given it him and his friends & acquaintances have raised him £100 as I am told though they never expect it againe and all this for to save his life they will do and more if neede required it & since in all probability this will be the last that I shall desire of you I pray to God to open your heart this case and never no more do I do find it to be so hard to me as to provide what I have of thus heartily begged of a Mother whom no body would believe but that the naturall tie of affection should stirr you up to this most charitable deed towards me who am \\nDeare Mother\\n\\nYour poore distressed yet dutifull son\\n\\nRich. Brumfould\\nRemember my kind love to every body\\n Iam sure all this is reason and you ought in Conscience to thinke that what I have done amiss to you before is not a good reason for you to deneigh what I aske for my life for I am sure if I am [words struck out] hanged I can lay the blame on none but you since I am escaped out of the greatest and worse danger and tis in your power to keepe me so though I am the Author of it I must Confess my selfe to be the Originall Cause of the trouble yet you may as well say that God is the author of sin as I the occasion of my death if I am taken but you are [words struck out]. My reasons are these first as J am your son there naturall affection ought to oblidge in one respect [word illegible] I have beene a great sinner and if I should be taken off by such a suddaine accident God have Mercy of my soul for I have deserved none. Pray thinke of this and send me an Answere by all means in the world for I am almost distracted and fuller of care than where I were in Prison for now I am sensible of my waies and unhappy Condition.\\n For Madam Barbara Hartshorne att Mr Jayes an Apothecaries at the sign of the golden Lion in Fenchurch Street in London\\n ',\n",

       "  'TEXT': \"[167] Calendar of State Papers, domestic, Charles II, February 1684°Samuel Starkey to Secretary Jenkins.\\n I presume you have had an account of the trial at the Old Bailey on Lord Paget’s indictment of trespass against Mr. Hartshorn and myself whereon we were each fined 100/., Lord Sunderland’s warrants (though they both expressly authorized us to search all suspected places) not being approved authentic to search his house, being a peer, but no law or precedent was suggested to or by the court to prove its illegality, and counsel are since of opinion that the verdict and judgment was misled by mistake or error and that our defence was not duly argued for want of counsel, that the same ought to be reversed by appeal to the King and Council, and that the statute that says a peer’s house shall not be searched without the Lord Lieutenant or Deputy Lieutenant, etc., for arms does not affect our case nor exempt any house or place from being searched for traitors especially in so hot and close a pursuit as we then were in. But I refer this and all other matters to your more mature determination. After I had so eminently hazarded my life and fortune in accusing and actually apprehending Aaron Smith and Simon and Samuel Maypn, by virtue of your warrant and that of three Deputy Lieutenants to search for and seize arms, etc., and by the assistance of several parties of militia horse assigned by the Earl of Bridgwater, I made a strict search for above twenty days and nights together and seized a great quantity of concealed arms, etc., at Mr. Wharton's and Mr. Hampden’s and narrowly missed Goodenough and Ayliffe at Enfield and also at Sir Roger Hill’s. After Lord Paget and Justice Newman had trepanned me out of Whitehall and secured me without warrant or commitment a day and night close prisoner and without warrant seized and perused some of my private papers, and after I was released by you and committed four days to a messenger’s custody and on an examination before a Cabinet council, then and not till then Lord Paget and Sir Roger, to stiffle my testimony, pretended I had robbed them in searching their houses, whereon I was recommitted to the Gatehouse to be prosecuted, but I was confined above five months and neither prosecuted, tried, bailed or discharged though | thrice tendered 10.000/. bail. At last Lord Paget shrank his pretensions to an indictment of trespass only and suffered that too to sleep for four sessions, so that at last I was forced to impanel a jury at my own charge and give notice of trial at Hicks’ Hall, but then to deprive me of the defence I had there made ready of witnesses and counsel he removed the cause and without notice tried it by surprise at the Old Bailey.\\n Sir Roger resolves to prosecute me at the next Aylesbury assizes, 3 March. The guards assigned to assist us in our said search of Lord Paget’s and Sir Roger's house are a party of Sir Francis Compton’s troop and are our only witnesses. My life and reputation lie at stake and can be preserved only by their testimony at the trial. Being a young man and rendered defenceless through a long imprisonment, I am altogether incapable of taking such effectual measures as my case requires. Since I have fallen under these unhappy circumstances and through my said services have created many inveterate animosities amongst the factious party, and Lord Paget and Sir Roger and others through their instigation have made great stickling to stiffle my evidence and irritate his Majesty and Council and yourself against me, I hope you will not prejudge my cause but consider there is always a malignant party always ready to stigmatize those that are most loyal and indefatigable to serve his Majesty. Therefore | pray your favourable assistance that the said party of the Guards may be specially ordered to attend and give their testimony on my behalf at my trial at Aylesbury and that all my said warrants and papers may be forthwith redelivered me or secured in some safe hands ready to produce at my trial. \",\n",

I perceive you received mine by Mr Y. but mention nothing of the letter I sent you by Mr Kirby wherein I acquainted you that Mr Scot had paid me one & twenty pounds for you, and I desired to know how you would dispose of it. This day I saw him & gave him your Letter, & excused your writing to him for that which he had done before, because I thought you had not my Letter when you wrot, but if you send an [word struck out] Acquittance for him I will take in mine againe for I only mentioned so much were received for your use. I delivered Mr Miller and Cosin Mackley your Letters as you desired, & when I wrot all desired to have their loves remembred to you. They are all in health save she Cosin Jaye who remains still very weak & bad. Cosin Wightman is got abroad again but is yet weak. Your presentation at Rye is no other than that I thought would have overtook you sooner. The Lord fit you for it. And if you do stay there you must expect it or worse. So far as I can see, I knowno friend you have there that will shelter you from the storme, unless God do more for you than he hath done for many others of his own, & what ground you have to expect it you may consider. John White may sell the part of the house Mr L: dwells in because it come to him as heire and is Gavelkind\\'® provided he have a valuable consideration & deliver the possession actually, but otherwise the Sale is not good. I think £25 is not a valuable consideration. The buyer must looke to it. His part in the land cannot be sold till he is full 21. because the land is not Gavelkind. The security taken in the names of Infants I think is good being for their advantage.

So J intend God willing to set out next Munday morning & hope to see you before Tuesday night, I thank you for your last letter of the 2d Instant which I read with great satisfaction, and as I doubt not of the sincerity of your affections. So assure your selfe my dearest that nothing can alienate mine from you. I think my time as long ere I revisit you, as you can possibly before you see me. I received not your Letter till yesterday morning. The things I have sent which you will receive by Hawkherst Carrier were put on on Thursday in a box & sent down Friday morning because the Tryall being on Thursday I thought I should have come down yesterday morning, but Cosin Wightman being desirous to Conferr with his Counsell afterwards whether any thing more could be done this terme would have me stay to know the result lest I should be subpenaed again the same terme, & we could not find him to have his opinion till a few hours ago. There is in the Box the hangings which are green & white a very large leaf & pretty figure, which I liked so well that I bought 24 yds and judged that it would do better to cover the Stooles & for a Carpet & every thing else of the same, which will be better then to have the stools covered with another stuff. But I suppose you will do nothing about it till I come home. The box is very full of things therefore if you have it open’d take care you do not tear the stuff, for I don’t know but the nails may take hold of it at some places. I am glad to hear little Betty is well & your selfe with my Mother & Cosin Frebody, & that she is safely delivered. Ihave a letter for her in my Pocket but shall now keep it & bring it my selfe it is from her husband who is well but I happened to miss of him yesterday. My father is well & all Relations & friends. Severall remember to your Cosin Mackley. I must particularize because I am there. Give my remembrances to Mother & else where due. The spoon for little Betty I shall bring with me.

I was at the Nags Head in Jewen Street about the books you call Bibles. But they askt so excessive dear for those that were handsomly bound that I have not yet bought any. The reading is very little not so much as you have printed for 2d. And the book not above 2 Inches square & they ask 12d a book. I suppose one may have them for 11d or 10d. But then I question whether any body will buy them. There are some they ask 8d for & perhaps will take 6 but they have no lines of gold on the Covers. You may write me what they that have any of them give for them, & then I shall know if they ask too much. But I believe 2 dozen will be as many as she will be able to dispose of. It’s thought now tha Sir G: Rook* will return with our fleet, before the French. And I hope we are inno danger from France neither by sea nor land. But if the French should attempt to come into the Channell, we are satisfied that we have fleet enough in the Downs to fight them. And the French forces I believe are certainly withdrawn from Calais back into Flanders. So that I hope if there should be any idle reports you will not be afraid nor in any danger. For all things go well here & we are not under any apprehensions of any thing the Jacobites or French can do. Yesterday Sir W. Parkyne and Sir J: Friend were executed.” The Resolutions of Parliament in Thursdays votes are worth your seeing, you have them [word lost] Rye.

Doubt not but I have you always in my thoughts with requests to the blessed God through Jesus Christ for your welfare in this life but especially for your eternal happiness.

Original letter.\\nESRO FRE 5303 [Upper portion of the letter is damaged,\\n[Damaged section] So that you will have time to write to your sister Holman {and] her husband about it, & let him send me a letter & [word lost] speak to Sir Jn° on his behalf, & let my sister also write to [word lost] how great a kindness it will do her to prevent her removing [word lost] & then I will shew the letters to Sir Jn° & move him to it again [word lost] Mr Pulteney and Mr Austin to use their interest for him & if I can before; I will leave it with Mr Miller, for Sir n° ordered me to [word lost] memorandum with him to mind him of it at his return. So [word lost] have no precipitation about it for nothing can be done this mo[nth]. Give my service to Mr Maior, & tell him I have spoke for the [word lost] to be sent him every Post, & it was ordered to be done accordingly. [word lost] is very well pleased to hear he is Maior, & said he would write to him before long, I find our management is very well liked of, as I [intend] to signify further by letter to him assoon as J have leisure & op[portunity]. In the mean time I know he lacks no courage to do that which is for [the good] of the Corporation. I was busied also yesterday in buying 100 in the Bank which was then at 86 or 87. but the broker tells me to not buy yesterday & he did not doubt but he should get it to day viz for 85 %. He has appointed to meet me at the Bank Munday [word lost] when he saith I shall have it transferred. It was at 91 or 92 but [down?] since upon some demur about the peace, and if there be a further d[elay] I suppose it may sink to 80 for such is the humor here up & down everyday almost. So that this is the venture: next Monday comes [news] from Holland mail & it depends on that tise or fall but I must venture [some]thing or else do nothing, so that I mean to buy one 100 more & [word lost] the demur of the peace, for I hope that may not be a long demur, & if [news] of the conclusion of the peace should come then I believe it will be at 100 in a days time, so that then it will be to late, for Iam resolved not to follow it so high. E: India stock is sunk to 54. & I find no encoura[gement] to do any thing there at present. I resolve to be very cautious of that. I shall have money enough here with my bank note of £27 16s 9d to pu[rchase] this 100 in the Bank, so I shall not need to take up any of Mr Fer{ris] except what I shall pay him again here whilst I stay in London. [If] John Dickson ask you about the bond I have to receive for him the man says he will pay it about a week hence perhaps it may be fortnight since but I am apt to think it be paid in some little time. Flaxseed I have not thought yet about: so proceed according to the Instructions I left with you. I [word lost] Mr Tucker may have wrote his son the prizes of Hops. I have [no] leisure yet to go into Southwark nor seen him since we parted [word lost] Mr Miller’s folks are all in the country. My duty to my mother, love [to] children & all friends. Which with my affection to you is all at present.\\n \\nYour ever lo: husband\\n\\nSa: Jeake.\\n\\nTell Betty I intend to write to her before long.

I suppose you will expect to hear from me once a week & therefore write now though have not much business. I am told that the Lottery tickets due at Michaelmas 1696 are sold for 17s per Ticket that is 3s in the pound loss, & I do think to sell mine that remained after I purchased the Annuity at that rate if I can. For there will be no money to be had on them till next summer at soonest. Mine that I have remaining of that year come to £12 for which I shall have £10 4s at that rate which if I can get I am inclined to take: Now I write you that you may let my Mother know of it, she has £40 in Tickets of that year which at 3s per £ discount will make but £34. If she be willing to sell hers at the same rate I will do my endeavor for it. I think it will be the best way, for then she will be nothing behind till next Michaelmas: But if I can{not] meet with an opportunity to sell them, then she must either keep them till next summer when it’s thought the Parliament will provide for [word lost] payment or else if she care to buy 16 Bla[nk] Tickets more which she may have at 17s [word lost] she may purchase a Reversion of some [word lost] life with them & those she has for which she may have £14 per ann when the party dyes, if the security continue. You must let me know her mind per next post. As to flaxseed follow my directions already given & buy what offers at those rates. As for Hops, I must leave that to Mr Tucker, he [knows] my mind how far I am willing to be concerned [word lost] not above £50 as I remember he said also he did not intend to go above. I know not what price they are at for I have no time to go into Southwark till next week. If he can buy for .9. I believe there is no danger. His father thought he could do something in the country so I left it to him, for I take his judgment to be better than mine. I have put off my bank note at par. And got off [word lost] of my bank bill. Bank stock is now again at .86. Great expectations there are that next mail from Holland will bring news of the peace: but I fear it will not be so soon. Mr Miller’s child has been very ill he is now gone into the country. Cosin Jay (& his wife) give service to you & Mother & Betty.

Original letter. \\nESRO FRE 5306\\n\\nLondon Sept 14\" 1697\\n\\nMy Dear\\nThad not written you to night, but that the good news of the peace coming this morning. I thought would be more welcome to you from my hand than another, though I doubt not but other Letters will come assoon to the same purpose. Tis I believe now certain, this coming by express from Holland, with this account that the peace was signed last Friday night by the Plenipotentiarys of England, Holland, Spain & France with liberty for the Emperor to sign in such a time and Strasburgh to be restored to the Empire or the Equivalent which of the Two the Emperor chuses. The King is now expected over in a very short time. And things will look with a good face again. Bank stock was yesterday at 86 & I thought to have ventured another 100 today or tomorrow. But to day morning assoon as I went out he[ard] the welcome news of peace which [thanks] be God is much better. For now to day at Exchange time Bank stock was at 98 a good rise in a days time. So that now I have given over all thought of buying hoping ‘twill rise so that so that I [may] think of selling before long. Tomo[rrow] we have a Court at the Bank where I hope we shall be ordered our Bonds in & to receive our dividend. Pray don’t trouble me with any errands, I pray tell Mr Tucker I was in Southwark to day, but could hear no news from Sturbridge Fair. Mr Travell told me hops had some stur on them, at least would not go currant at above £10 or £10 5s there I think it not prudence to run much above 9 in the Country, for now there is a peace there will be a noise made of the importing of forrain hops. I wrote you last I did not care to go above £150 deep in that commodity. As to flax seed buy what you can, but do not exceed what I ordered for now forrain flaxseed will be imported. Tell Mr Tucker I would willingly have a letter from him [and] know what he has done about hops, or what he is like to do.

But as for Apps’s, if it be so bad as you write it is no matter whether he come again or no. However what you have bid him I would have you stand to. You had best keep their samples for sometimes they are apt to bring samples better than their goods are. I doubt not but you will buy all you can & get them to bring it in assoon as they can. & keep the white by it self & the brown by it self. I could not hear how hops were at Sturbridge fair last post & I have not time to go into Southwark now. I wrote you last post what I heard that hops were then at a stur, but how it is now I know not. But I depend that Mr Tucker will have advice from Southwark by the man he said he write to for that purpose. I refer you to my last letter about hops. I still think it’s not worthwhile to give above 9 in the country. I do not hear anything since of my Chapman about the Tickets, But now there is peace I doubt not but we shall be paid in time. I went to Mr Offley this week & he promised me to speak for Br Holman to some of the Commissioners that he knows, of which have given her account by post. For me to go to Mr Strong &c. whom I know not will signify not a farthing. I am glad to hear so many new freeman made &c. There’s no need of certificates yet about the Annuities. Yesterday I was at the Bank Court, where the Governour told us we should have our Bonds del[ivered] up when we would, & should have warrants [word lost] our overplus viz. 3 2 p Cent. at Michaelmas. You may tell Mr Manooch I will take care to receive his when I receive mine. I suppose it will be paid by Michaelmas. Bank is now at 95. That\\'s usual for it to waver here every day.

Original letter. \\nESRO FRE 5308\\n\\nLondon Sept. 21\" 1697\\n\\nMy Dear\\nIhave yours of the 18\\'\" & like well what you do about flaxseed, only am troubled that I cannot ease you of that trouble by my presence but there is no help for it at present for I think it necessary for me to stay some time longer here. I would have you imploy Goddin when you want any help about the flaxseed, and of all you buy get it in assoon as you can, for when there is a quantity of 30 or 40 quarters I intend to have it to London. As for money if my mother be willing to let you have £30 I will pay interest for that which with what you have will do for the present & £10 I suppose Mr Curtis will bring soon after Michaelmas. But if you find you shall want more let me know a week before you think you shall need it & I can have it here, for Mr Miller being to have % will pay his part here, & I shall take care to remitt it you. I would have you send to Colman the Tailor & tell him before my Mother (who may be a witness) that if he intend to stay in my house I shall not let it under 50s per year. Only because he may be unprovided I will condescend that he may tarry till Ladyday at the rate of 40s per annum. And know his mind one way or other before Michaelmas day. Then after you have done this send to Mr John Curteis junior or his wife & give them warning either to continue in my house at £4 per annum or else to leave it at Ladyday, be sure give warning before Michaelmas. I shall never get any rent of them & therefore I must take this occasion & now there is peace I do not fear a Ten{an]t. If Colman refuse tocontinue as above then you may tell Mrs Curtis if she will remove thither at 50s per year, she may which I will admit of because she was your midwife, for I shall be always troubled to get the Rent. But that keep to your self. If Colfman] leave his house its like he will go back into his own & [word lost] perhaps Smith may hire or buy mine, which my Mother m[ay] mention to them if it should so fall out. Bank stock continues at 95 1/2. I wrote you before I had received my Bank Note of £27 16s 9d. And I have received £41 7s 5d on my Bank seal’d bill & tomorrow I am like to receive £30 more & this week or next [ shall have my dividend of 3 % per % which is £31 10s and my Bonds in. If John Dickson enquire about his Bond tell him I have received £25 of it & am prom[ised] the rest on Saturday & hope it will be then paid. When it is I will write word. I thank God for preserving our house from fire & for all his special Providence.\\n The Peace I hope will prove very advantagious to us. I would fain stay a little longer in hope the Bank will rise higher & though it costs me something more here in expenses & diet it must do if I continue here then it would do at home, yet I hope your saving there will make some compensation for it. I do think it may be worth my while to stay a month longer & to see how things will be when the king comes over, which I believe will give the stock another rise. I cannot sell our tickets at 17 therefore I mean to keep them, for I think they will be paid next year. If you can spare so much time hear Betty to construe some Latine & to say over the declensions & conjugations, else I shall have all to begin again at my Return. Give my duty to my mother, my love to you & the Children & Bab. I have sent the letter to her Mother*’ & seen her, & she will send a Cap before long. Give my service to Mr Maior, Mr Tucker, Mr Mannooch & other friends. If I have no business I shall write but once a week, therefore be not troubled when you have no letter, for if I should be ill you may depend on it I will not fail to write. But I have my health very well I bless God for it. Tell Mr Tucker that I have been in Southwark this afternoon to enquire about Hops. & now they tell me that Hops were run down at Sturbridge fair before it was done to £8 10s per hundred though I understand it was because the weather was very wet & dirty & they sold so rather than carry them back to London, some say there is a good crop in Flanders & many are expected from thence. There lyes our greatest danger in bringing over Flemish hops. The market in Southwark is dull from £9 10s to £9 15s or £10. But tomorrow is the great market day for hops there & Mr Travel has promised me to send me by penny post how they go there & I will not fail to give him further advice by next post. But I believe it will be a dull market. For the weather being so very wet they will come up in a dirty condition & being dull already are not like to quicken this week. In the mean time I think it best to forbear buying any more till he hears further. And as for those already bought I am clear of opinion to send them up assoon as possible, for after this dulness it’s very like they may quicken again in October & then we shall be ready for the market before forrain hops can possibly come in. Besides the price being considerable it will be best to make our returns assoon as we can. Mr Miller & wife &c remembers to you, to my mother & Betty, as also to Mr Tuckers.

I am told that the Million Lottery Tickets which will be now due this 29\" of Sept. 1697, will be paid first soon after Michaelmas, which makes me sorry that I did not cut them off & bring up with me.** Therefore I would have you some day next week when you are at leisure, to look in my Chest & you will find uppermost a large bag with papers in it amongst which you will find one parcell superscribed [Benefit Tickets in the Million Adventure]” open it & cut off neatly one payment which you will find dated 29 — Sept. 1697 both of my Mother’s benefit & mine. Then under the said Bag you will find 2 parcells of blank Tickets which are my Mothers & mine, 20 in each. Take them & cut off the payments which you find dated 29. Sept. 1697. You may observe how to cut them off by observing how the former have been cut, tis best done with a penknife. When you have them all off the Total will come to £55 viz: my Mothers benefit £10 & her 20 blanks & my benefit £5 & my 20 blanks. Then double them once & fold them up in a brown paper or two & so put them in a letter directed to me at Mr Millers in Dunstan Court Mincing Lane & keep them till Mr Harris or Mr Tucker come to London & desire either of them to bring it to me & if I not be Within to leave it with Mr Miller or his wife (you need not tell Mr Harris what itis, only desire him to have a great care of it there being papers of concern in it). 1am within always at 3. a clock afternoon to be sure. I am glad you do so well about flaxseed. Take note I paid Geo: Hills 2s 6d which outset when you pay him if his be so bad as you write perhaps he may be willing to abate something or to stay till I may return however I would not have you differ with him for the matter will not be great.

You do very well about the flaxseed. I do not find any rise of the prizes here so keep at 35s per quarter the highest unless you think fit to 36s for any prime parcell but be sure don’t exceed that for any. Don’t go after Reubens if he don’t come to you let it go for we had better sit still then buy too dear. If Tho: Morrow don’t come till November, I hope you may have it all in in October & if he will carry it reasonable I had rather have it by him because I have imploy’d him before. I suppose he will not expect above 2s per quarter now there’s peace. You may also ask him if he will carry it & at what price & let me know. You will have time enough for you cannot have all in this month. As to wheat you must buy as the market price is what you want. I don’t trouble my self about your buying the Horse but seeing you may either take or leave him till maytide you need not resolve yet till I come home which hope may be in November for I am desirous to see another dividend at the Bank which will be at the end of October hoping that may advance it something more. However I have received my Bonds this morning & cancell’d them & have also received £31 10s besides in money for my dividend of 3 4 p Cent. The Stock is sunk a little viz to 96 but there’s nothing in it but the humour of the people. I am sorry to hear my Mother is ill, & you also I will take care about the Prunes if I can get those that are good. I wish you would accustom yourself to drink more, & then I believe it would be better. I am glad to hear Mr Tucker & his wife are on recovery. I have wrote to him severall times to send the Hops up his father bought by way of Maidston but hear nothing from him. I would fain have them sent up assoon as possible. Now they are dull indeed between 9 & £10 per hundr[ed] but the charge of standing is inconsiderable now they are at so great a price & here we shall have them ready fora market. For now we expect peace will be proclaimed next week at furthest & then there will be fitting of ships to sea apace for Irela[nd] & the West Country & much brewing here, so that it’s very likely they may be quick in a fortnight, but perhaps not hold so long. For when they hear of it in the country then they will send them up from Canterb[ury] & Maidston whereas this week it being dull there were but few brought up that I heard of. My Remembrances where due.

You may enquire among the shopkeepers & assoon as you will draw Thirty pounds on me & write your bill thus \\nRye Oct: th 1697.\\n\\nper £30\\nAt three days sight hereof pay to Mr A.B. or order the summe of Thirty Pounds Sterling value of himself as per advice of\\n \\nYour Lo: Wife\\n\\nE: J.\\n\\nin Dunster Court Mincing Lane London\\nBut if my mother be willing to lend you £30 till I come home I had rather so. For I can use the money I have here to pay for my part of the hops Mr Tucker bought & perhaps I may meet with something else that may be probable to do well. However if you think not fit to do so, draw it on me for you shall not want as long as I have it. I hope I may return by the middle of November. But I would fain tarry till then. I wrote you word last post to mind Mr Tucker to send up the hops which I think of greater importance to me than the flaxseed because they come to more money, & are a hazardous commodity. I wonder I hear nothing from him nor his father as if they minded it not though to me it seems of concern. The Bank is at 96 & I hope now ina very good condition our bills being at par. For now I hear any one may have his money upon the old sealed Bills, & after the 10\" of Oct it’s said the Bank will allow no interest for any sum under £100 & for all greater sums put in they allow now but 3 per Cent which I doubt not but will raise the stock. I wrote you before, I have my dividend & bonds in. And the latter end of this month we do expect another of 2 2/3 per Cent which will be to me £26 13s 4d so I would stay this month to see what effect this will have upon the stock. I was about buying another 100 if I could have got it for 95 but I think not to exceed that. For if it rise above 100 I intend to sell some. I think never more to give above 100 as I did before. I am heartily sorry I am forc’t to give you so much trouble about flaxseed but I know not how to help it my concerns being so great here. There are [no] good Prunes to be got at London however I sent you 14lb of the best that were to be had which yet are none of the best though very dear 4d per lb. You will have them on Munday per Carrier. I am sorry to hear my Mother is ill.

You have done as well as if I had made him the answer for unless it be extraordinary good it will be too dear at that price. And as for little parcells don’t give above 34 at most. You do manage it so well that I cannot do better. As for white flaxseed by no means give above 26s per quarter &not so unless it be of the very best, for some of it is dear enough at 20. And if it be very full of dirt you had better not buy it at all for it will spoil the rest. It still troubles me that I can not free you from this fatigue. But I believe shall return about mid: Nov: if not before. Mr Miller’s remembrances to you & Cos: Jay’s. If Mr Bernard should come to our house, I desire you to receive him with respect. I am sorry I could not be present for I should have been glad to have some discourse with him. Mr Tucker it’s like will spend a little time with him.

I will not give you so much trouble as to send the flaxseed but tell Morrow I shall not send it till after Christmas which as it will free you from that fatigue which I would not by any means should fall upon you; so we think also it will come to a better market toward spring than now. Truly Iam much concerned for your trouble but I hope this will be some ease to your mind that I shall be home before it will need to be sent. I wrote you last post not to give above 32s for any brown, nor above 20s for white per quarter. & to let Goddin turn it. I thought I had wrote you every week if not I forgot my self. But if Mr Tucker did not tell you about Guineas it was his fault for I desired him particularly to acquaint you & I thought he might have done so much. To day in the Gazett is an advertisement that they [guineas] shall be taken for Custom & Excise &c at 22s. so that I am apt to think they may pass a while & many do take them so here for goods I believe no body refuses them. I will take care about your Petticoat & Combs. I do think as I wrote before to return in mid: Novembfer]. I would fain see whether we shall have a dividend first. To morrow we have a General Court at the Bank & I find most of the Members are for it, so that I hope there will be an order for one & when I have seen what Influence it has on the stock that if it tise I may sell some, and withall have waited a little to see whether hops will mend I shall think of returning. There’s no money on the Million Lottery. Several of the Proprietors are to meet next Wednesday to concert the best methods to obtain the Arrears where I intend to be with them. I suppose it will be to petition the Parliament about it assoon as they sit, before they fall on other business. Trouble not your self about the Poor Tax, thats all the mischief they can do.

You have done very well about Snoads flaxseed. Nevertheless if he should bring it in & insist upon your agreement I would have no difference with him but would give him 34s p quarter if he be so satisfied. For I would have every body easy that I deal with: Or if you find him much dissatisfied (as you know at the return of your messenger) I had rather give 36s then have any brawling about it. And so you may send him word if you find it convenient. For it’s a pretty great quantity & if it be very good 1am willing to have it, for I find there will not be much more to be had. If he have brought it in before you receive this then it must be adjusted when I return. But as for any other parcells I say as before give not above 32s per q[uarter]. Nor above 20s for white. I wrote to Mr Tucker to furnish you with £30 & that Iwould pay so much the more here towards the hops. But if he cannot or be not free then you must put away some Guineas for my mother at 22s as they go currant for Goods. Or you may draw £30 on me. Only if you draw on me let me know when you write again which way you intend to make use of that my money may be ready. I hope you are better in health & am glad to hear my little girl is mending. Madam Thompson says bole Armoniack® & white sugar candy powdered & blown through a quill into her mouth is good if it be of the nature of the Thrush. I wrote you last post that I will not send the flaxseed till after Xmass. So you will not be troubled with shipping it. The Commiss[ioners] of Excise would [word lost] nothing this winter but next spring I think some[thing] may be done for Br H[olman]s remove. I hear nothing yet about Mr Bridon. Ask Mr Tucker if there be any vessel going to Exceter, because he wrote he was inclined to send our hops thither. The Dividend was put of at the Bank till December. Stock is at 92.

Or if you should hear from him anymore if you give above 34 s per quarter for it, if you find he will not let it go under you may venture so far. I will take care about the spectacles. I doubt not but you will send up the butter. You may send it by Morrow for I believe he will take most care of it. I would not have you draw any money on me at present because I have bought £100 more of Bank Stock at 914 so that I cannot well spare any at present. And I hope you will not have occasion to draw because you have paid for most of the flaxseed already bought. & if you should buy Snoads you may agree with him to stay till I come home, which I believe he will not stick at seeing he may expect it in a month, which is as ready money for goods. You may send a letter to Mr W™ Curteis if you please for £10 interest due to me at Michaelmas, which I believe he will pay assoon as he receives notice from you. The King is expected next week.

I am well satisfie, about Snoad’s flaxseed, there will be nothing to be got by it at that rate would not have you give above 4s per bushel for any nor that neither unles. extraord[inary] good. But you manage it so well that I can give you no directions. If Mr Stone should come again you may ask him whether it be about his money, if it be tell him you will write to me & I will take care he shall have it or what part he desires in a month. This day the King came through the City to the great joy of the people who desired he might come in the day that they might see him, he came in a coach, but the Glasses afforded a good sight of him on either side the way. Tell Mr Tucker that I can advise him nothing new about Hops. The King’s coming has made every body keep holiday. But if he can sell those hops between us that cost 8 for £9 or upwards in the country I am of opinion to take it. For they are certainly dearer there than here. It’s true it’s possible they may hold up. But if the Parliament should take off the duty on forrain hops for this year which is 50s per Cent, or if they should make another tax on goods as they did last, either of these will sink the price what ever other accidents happen. I tarry a little to see what effect the sitting of the Parliament will have on the Bank (which is now at 89) for if they be favourable to us as there is no great fear but they will, then I shall return the better satisfied. I believe Miller is come away [before] this. I have not had time to mind a cheese at present. The Jack I did not send because I was afraid you would run it into your fingers at opening the parcell so keep it till | come. I received yours by Mr Warner. My duty to Mother, my love to you & Betty & 2 Babs & Sam. I am glad to hear he thrives well.

And that is that I have gotten £30 for my Mother & £25 for my self on our Lottery Tickets. And that I have sold the Land at Wadhurst for a Market price, and as for my Mother’s money on it will be continued upon the same security I gave her which is without dispute. Tell Mr Tucker I have accepted his bill of £100 & shall pay it next week. Hops continue as they were. I am not for selling any more as the markets go but waiting till spring when I hope they may be somewhat quicker. I hope you have not neglected to send the Butter. I have bought you a cheese which shall be sent by the vessell that brings the Butter. The Bank is up at 87 4 standing at a stay. I wrote to know if my mother would buy £100 if it fell to 80 which if she be inclin’d to I shall be ready to serve her if there be an opportunity. I tarry now to finish the receiving the money for the hops I sold here & some money I am to receive on the sale of the Land & also to see a little how the Parliament will act about the Bank of which we have a good prospect that they will favour us rather than our adversaries, & when these things are over I think of returning which I hope may be in a fortnight. But you shall hear from me about the day senight or the day following & then I hope to tell you more certainly of my return.

I have spoke to Moon the Carrier to bring me up a horse next week which he will do, & so you may hope to see me this day sennight if God assist. But if any extraordinary business should make my stay necessary till the week after I may then continue the horse here till that time. I mean chiefly in reference to the Bank which is now at 90 or 91 & some think we shall have a dividend ordered the 15 of December at which time will be a General Court. And this would make it rise higher were it not for fear some Tally men will petition the Parliament fora new engraftment, yet I think there is no real fear [of] it. I am told they begin to pay some [of] the Annuities. So I intend to see about that next Tuesday. I send you the Kings speech which is worth you reading & hope things will go well with us at last. I hope to be at home before the Gooders come I intend them 6d a piece. I would not have you take the Guineas unless youcould put them away immediately as you took them, nor meddle with any Pistols for they are worth but 17s 4d.

But I won’t give you any trouble to ship it, for there is no such hast, I have sold it & am at liberty to send it when I please. I have received % s Annuitys at the Exchequer which is £9 10s so there’s less behind. I have paid Mr Thompson his £100 & taken in my bond. I have bought £100 stock for my mother in the bank, & £100 more for myself at 89 per Cent which is to be transferred to morrow on which day there is a General Court & we expect a dividend will be ordered of 4 per Cent which will reduce the stock I bought for my mother & self this day to 85. It was uncertain whether it would come lower, & therefore I thought it best for her to be concerned a little in it as it is which I hope will do well. I shall take care to pay for it here & reckon with her when I come home. Tell Mr Tucker I would not have him draw any money for the hops till I return for if they [will] take the £100 due at xmas for hops at Rye I can pay it better there.

I wrote you last post to see if Mr Maior would let me have the money that Mr Miller received for him & you to pay him the money there which this confirms. If you can have that money I shall want more besides & therefore I did speak to Mr Ferris this day & he saith that Robt Brown” can return 80 or £100 if he have not disposed of it already which he thinks he hath not & therefore doth write to him this post to let me have it before any one else. So pray go to Robert Browne & get a bill of him for £100 or for as much as you can if he cannot let you have the whole, & send it me up next post for then Mr Ferris will pay it me upon sight. Borrow money of my mother to pay for it. I will allow her Interest for the time I keep it.

Mr Dupper is a man I don’t know & therefore he may be content that I should receive the money here before you pay him at Rye. But if you be satisfied about him by Mr Tucker or Wm Mercer then if he desire it you may let him have the money when you take his bill, if you have not his bill before this comes to hand then let it be drawn at 3 days sight which I had rather than at sight for fear of miscarriage. If you cannot have the whole £100 of him then see to get it of Nic: Stone, Mr Wilmshurst, John French or Robt Brown or some other that you know is sure, and assoon as you can. I hope to be back sometime in May, but cannot yet fix the time. I saw Cosin Betty Wightman in London & suppose she will come to Rye if I come by Maidstone which I think to do.

I have had no time yet to consider your letters about what you desire to be bought, but I shall mind it next week. I wrote you I had bought some Bank stock which will excuse my Tax, but I hope to be at home time enough to plead that, for it is not yet past & cannot be in the country before the end of May. Bank was yesterday at 105. I have received my mother’s dividend £9 which will account with her when I come home.

You may remit £80 more assoon as you have opportunity from safe hands, but I would not have you hurry your self about it, for I can shift well enough till you meet with it conveniently which I suppose you may ina week or fortnight time. I had a Letter from Sister Holman wherein she writes me word that she and her Brothers & Sisters will all be at Rye on Wednesday the 26\"\" of Aprill. I do write to Mr Tournay this post to give him notice of it & that he may pay his money here if he please. But however if he do not pay his money at Rye do not let him have the Bond till you have advice from me first that the money is paid here. I do also write to Mr Taylor this post to let him know that they appoint to be at Rye on the 26\" of April. But lest my letter should not come to his hand, I think it would be meet for my mother to send one over to him to Tenterden on Friday next to acquaint him with it. I suppose you may get one to go over afoot for 2s. As for Mr Tournay you need not trouble your self for if he do not come the fine may be levied without his being there. Tell Betty I have not time to answer her letter now. She may take the Spirit of Savery Grass she mentions, it may do her good. I shall Endeavour to do all the errands you have mentioned in all your letters. & am glad you have sent them all already for I would not have any new things mentioned when my time draws neer to come away, because I shall dispose of what money I have more than the things come to for other purposes & then that will put me to a non-plus to have other things to buy besides I shall want time. But if you have forgot anything that you would have for your self I will endeavour to oblige you, but not any body else. Bank was yesterday 105 1/2. I would have you keep on Sam’s bongrace* & let him be led till his eye is thorough well for a fall will make it return again. Better lead him about a month too long than a day too short.

Original letter.\\nESRO FRE 5329\\n\\nLondon Apr 25\" 1699\\n\\nMy Dear\\nI received yours of 22\" Instant I shall take care about the errands you wrote, as time & opportunity serve me. I am sorry to hear Betty is not well, nor Sam’s eye. I hope he has had no more falls. I had a letter from Mr Tournay that he will be at Rye to morrow and pay the money there; The Butter is come by Tho: Morrow. Madam Miller says that Trains are worn still with womens upper petticoats but not so long as formerly; And as for fringes she saith they wear them strait but she would not advise you to alter any for they are worn both ways, Twas a good time to have bought in the Bank yesterday for it fell from 105 to 104 upon a blind story of the Frenches coming. But that being blown over it rose again today to 104’. As for telling when ‘tis a good time to purchase that’s past my skill or any body’s else. I have taken up sixty five pounds of Mr Newman of Winchelsea for which I gave him a note payable the 26\" of May before which time I hope to be at home. Madam Miller desires to know whether the silk you would have drawn with Indian sprigs be for a Mantua or for a Lining, for she saith if it be for a Mantua it will be so very tedious for you to work it that she would rather advise you to have it painted with lively flowers which shews exceeding well & may be done for about 15s & will wear very well provided it don’t come to wet which you will have no occasion to use it in. So she would have you send word next post. I cannot yet meet with any iron kettles that hold above 8 gallons or 10 at most. So have not bought yet. I have received one & Twenty pounds & nineteen shillings of Tho: Morrow for which I being absent Mr Miller hath drawn a bill upon you this day by my order paiable at sight to one Mr John Atkins or order, which I desire you to pay when bought to you. I think he is a Lydd* man but that is not material. Take a Receit on the bill when you pay it, If he come not himself then see if his name be endorsed on the bill or else do not pay it. I have spoke to Mr Ferris & he saith he will write to Robt Brown to let you have 2 Retum the first he can. So I would have you get £100 mre of him unless you can meet with it or part of it before he can let you have it, you may take up money of my mother till I come home. My remembrances & Mr Miller\\'s [to you] all in hast Iam my dear Your [ever] Lo: husband\\n \\nSa: Jeake.\\n\\nTo Mrs Eliz: Jeake at Rye in Sussex\\n',\n",

I know not how to inform her any thing more about Allington Court than what Mr Tournay told her & so you may write her for its not worth while to put her to 2d charge to send her a letter from hence. Your silk is put out to paint & will be done next week & with your mantua. | intend to send your best petticoat, being of most value. Other things I have put aboard Tho: Morrow to day viz: 1. fir box full of things viz: A large Bible which when it comes to hand pray lay it up carefully till | come home. There is also my watch in a little box which mind to take care of. Then there is all the shooes you sent for except 1 of your shoes which was not brott till the box was sent away so I must send it to you hereafter. Then there is my Gown, the ovens door, | p Holland of 19 ¥ ells, Nans bible. 3 lb Hair powder. 6 washbals. | pr shoes for me. the point pattern. Wafers, 1 pr stockings. 2 shirts. 2 caps. 2 cravats. 2 pair wristbands. 3 pair gloves, & that you sent. 4 pillowcoats. | flannel petticoat. | pair pattens, | pair clogs. 2 pewters for washbals. 1 Frock or Gown for Bab cut out. 1 Green Girdle & other green Ribbon. % yd black stuff anterine.* All this is in the box together with other small things. Then there is a parcell tyed up together where you will find 6 psalm books for Wm Mercer & the stuff that Mrs Betty bott for Nan 16. Yds. & a brass potlid & a whisk. Besides I sent by Morrow an armed chair black with rush bottomed & also an Iron Kettle, which will be too little I fear but I could meet with no bigger though were at a many shops. Morrow talks of going down to morrow so I hope you will receive the things safe in a weeks time. I cannot buy the lining of the bed at present & I will tell you the Reason when I come home. As for Mr Tournays bond I don’t think it worth while to send it up if he pay any money here I can give him a Receit till he comes to Rye. As for the Report you have of the sickness being at London, there’s nothing in it. The City is very healthy at present. I have the promise of Mr Ferris & Mr Cox for £100 from Ro: Brown assoon as Mackrells come in viz. the first money he can draw for fish & therefore I would have you mind R Bfrown] of it for I perceive you cannot get any elsewhere if you can of a sure hand then you may return what you can otherwise & so take the less of R Brown.

I know not what price wheat is, but if so as I told you viz 7 s you might if you had opportunity sell 12 bushells, but if not it’s no great matter till I come home which I hope will be about the 29\" of May so that if the Cistern be not begun you may have it omitted till I come home, or how you please for it will please me either way it being a good time of year to do it in & dry weather.

The Tax is hardly printed yet so I suppose shall be at home before the day of appeals can possibly come, I am not taxable now for personall estate. But you need not mention any thing unless only you may write me when you hear the Tax is made for when that is made there is 10 days after for appeals, Bank is at 104, has stood at a stay for about a week.

I pray God continue it & restore your health & to him return thanks and in all your ways acknowledge him & he shall direct your pathes. I suppose the pain of your head may return again, but if it do be not out of heart: as it returns so it may remove. Man is born to trouble. Endeavor to make a sanctified use of all afflictions, & let all the dispensations of providence draw you nearer to God & more off from the world in which you are but a stranger as the Apostle speaks of the believer in the 11\" of the Hebrews who did not take up their rest in this world but looked for a City that hath foundations whose builder & maker is God. Look upon sin as the greatest Evil of all & pray to God not to lead you into Temptation. Avoid all occasions of sin, lest you be left to your own strength & fall, Keep in the way of God’s providence & in doing your duty & then you may expect his protection. Chuse affliction always rather than iniquity. These directions that I give you will be of use to you in after times as well as now even thro the whole course of your Life. It is a comfort to me that I have observed in you some good thing towards the Lord God of Israel & I trust he will perfect that good work he has begun in your conversion to him to serve the living God. If you acquaint your self with Christ it is not so much matter for acquaintance in the world. I commit you to God & remain\\n \\nYour affectionate father\\n\\nSa: Jeake\\n\\nTo Elizabeth Jeake at Madam Brewers at Fowlers in Hawkhurst in Kent\\n',\n",

Whether this be news to you or no I cannot tell, as such I write it, viz That as Parson Paul” was riding to Tyburn a man in a certain house in Holborn threw some dirt at him and hit him whereupon the Parson pulled off his Hat & said Sir | Thank you, upon which the Mob rose & had seized the Fellow had he not been carried off with a Guard, and finding they could not come at him they brake all the Windows in the House, & they were fore’d to set a Guard upon the House all that night for fear of its being demolished as the Mob threatened to do; likewise when they were at Tyburn the Mob began to be insolent, upon which an Officer who was there drew his Sword & cut one fellow (who was more insolent than the Rest) severely, upon which Wholsome Severity the Mob presently vanished. July the 13” last being Sunday a certain man in Moorfields who had a Place in the Pay Office hanged himself in his Garret. He had been melancholy for some time before.

I have been likewise with the Gold thread man & bought 4 ounce for which I gave 2s whether I have done well or ill therein I know not I can only say I got it as cheap as I cou’d & I hope I have pleased you therein. Mr Hudson hath sent the whole piece of Linsey per Hoy which he chargeth at 30s & he saith that if you have not occasion for it all you may use so much as you want & send him back the rest.

His Lady too gives her remembrances to the Family. She looks very big upon one, but is very brisk and well. Yesterday the 5 Rioters were hanged against Salisbury Court in Fleet-Street,* where was a vast Croud of Spectators; The poor deluded Populace (after they were hanged) cut off Chips from the Gallows which they sold for half pence or pence apiece to keep as Relicts of such pious martyrs of their Cause. That same Day also the Sign of the Roebuck was erected in Cheapside as likewise the Sign of the Mug under which is writ the Loyal Society of the Mug house which some poor wretches have peppered with dirt.

Witnesses recorded that the rioters, John Love, Thomas Bean, George Purchase, Richard Price and William Price broke windows, took down and destroyed the Mug House sign and destroyed household goods and papers. The Old Bailey Proceedings do not record the motivation for the attack but record the rioters as having cried “High Church and Ormond. No Hanoverian, No King George, Down with the Mug-house’ suggesting that they were Jacobite sympathisers or, at least, that the riot had been instigated by Jacobite sympathisers. Love was a dock worker, William Price an apprentice sword cutler, Richard Price a Welsh tailor who had come to London seeking work, Purchase a journeyman shoe-maker and Bean a servant to a gentleman who had been involved in the 1715 Jacobite rebellion.

It is now .22. weekes ago she finished her course, she sickened first like an Ague, upon the 29\" of October being Tuesday, on the wednesday she went out to Goodman Millers to repetition, the thursday the fit tooke her againe & held her as before, & on the friday she went out to a buriall which was the last time she was forth. On the Saterday she was tooke againe & so it held her all night & the next day being Sabbath she was very sicke, yet in the Afternoone she rose, but still continuing sicke, on the Monday as she lay, she read the .102. Psalme,” for the Lord seemed to hide himselfe from her, but he did not forsake her over long, in that night hee revealed himselfe to her in a sweet manner, so that her bruised bones leapt for joy, in the morning she revealed to us what a sweet night she had enjoyed, & how the Lord had let out him selfe to her from these words of the .36. Psalme 5.6.7.8.9. verses” and that now she had found by experience what we have yet but by promise, that heaviness may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning. Continuing sicke we sought to the Physician, this weeke like a Saint, her words ministered grace to the hearers, & she was perswaded she should dye on the Sabbath & that having done a weekes work she should enter into his rest yet God otherwise prevented & that Satan might take his last farewell of troubling her tooke occasion hereby to molest her but at length the Lord revealed himselfe to her more fully then before, so that about the middle of the weeke she told us she was as full of joy as her heart could hold. The Lord had now afflicted her with a sore mouth, which much troubled her to speake, about the latter end of the weeke we had good hope of her recovery, but God ordered it better for her gaine though for our losse, on the saterday night & Sabbath following she could take downe nothing but beere & suger with a feather & on the monday & tuesday she waxing worse & worse, we had little hope of life left in her, on the Wednesday being the .20\". day of November about .4. a clocke in the afternoone she sweetly yielded up her soule into her Fathers hands, catching up her hands together uttered these words Come Lord but what more could not be heard. Thus as you had acquaintance of her in her life, you are acquainted with a true relation of her death, that you may rejoyce with her & weepe with me, & that God to whom alone belong the issues of life & death helpe us to glorifie him in either of both conditions.
