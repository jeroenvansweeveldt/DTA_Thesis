Could we have had your cocheneale sooner from Genoa it might long err this have binn sould but thence though there never wants conveyances, yet the bad weather in the winter tyme makes them very tedious, and we waited some time too to see whether the captain would comply with his obligation in bringing it hither, which since they doe but what they please you would doe well in the future give your freinds caution if any direct conveyances offer to imbrace them rather then for Genoa, though now we are in tymes of peace we hope we shall have the lesse occasion of them and that our owne navigation wilbe imployed from whome we find fairer dealeing.

All the rest of your former cargoe is disposed, though a good parte of the money is still oweing amongst our shoppkeepers, but wee hope on the arrivall of the galleones shall recover the most part of it.

The latter may yeild a small advance and besides wee looke upon it as a riseing comoditie since there cann come noe more of it into Europe wee suppose in more than two yeares, and we intend to send two bagges to your selfe and Mr Letheilleire by the first merchant men, haveing excused to lade anything for youre account on the friggatts in regard by your order to the contrary.

Wee know not what comodityes to advise you to send to this markett at present, since wee conceive it will be overladen with most sortes of our English manufactoryes.

Soe, as such comodityes may be brought from England, and those sortes will undoubtedly have good demand in these partes, wee had some dayes past a few picotes made at Norwich which were here better liked then those made at Lysle, but our friendes advised us they cost in England neare 40s per peece, and heere the flemmings use to sell theire picotes, which contain 33 Spanish vares (which are 8 per cento lesse then English yards) at 11 pieces of cight per peece, in this citty. Soc if those sortes cannot be made in England to be afforded a little more or lesse as they have been from Flaunders there is noe dealing in them, though indeed they are more substantial]. If you can gett them cheape and finde encouragement to send any you need not question but they will have good expence; and having not else wee crave leave to remain, &c.",

With it we received the account of the 20 sacks of galls purchased and loaded in Marten Jansen Tiel. We have checked the account and agreed it with you. May God bring them in safety, The market is weak here and from others we have learned that these same goods can now be had for sss in [London], so in future they are likely to fall lower here. Meanwhile we hope you have bought and shipped the 20 sacks of Barbados cotton. The greatest speed is essential\u2014also that the goods are clean and soft.\n We hope you have procured payment of the \u00a3200 sterling which we remitted to you, drawn on William Rivet. With that you can pay for the cotton you have bought. Sugar is too dear in [London] and one can count on no profit in sending it here, so one must wait for it to fall lower in [London] or rise higher here. One can easily get it here at 8\u00a2 for lack of buyers. Silk is plentiful and cheap\u2014Ardasse can be got for 173s. We have accepted the bill of exchange for \u00a3170 drawn at 34s 1og, at double usance, payable to Caspar Bruyn or order, and when it falls due it will be promptly paid. Meanwhile we have debited it to your account.\n Would you please find out, discreetly, if one could get 20.000 to 30.000 ox-horns in [London]\u2014and how much per thousand they would cost, with all charges, free on board, and if one may export them wheresoever one wishes? Please give us reliable information about this and we will gladly serve you in return. With cordial regards, &c. Carsten Steen has arrived here. Nothing is yet heard of Marten Jansen Tiel. Barbados sugar no longer fetches even 8g here, choice quality being left without buyers. The highest it will now make would be 73g, so one would make a loss by sending it from [London].",

    "TEXT": "The above, dated 4 January, is a copy of our last letter. We have since received yours of the 13th of December and 3rd of January and fully understand the contents, to which our answer briefly follows.\n Concerning the Tar Company\u2019s bill of exchange, the matter will be settled as soon as Mr Hendrick Thuen returns home. He is away at present and has been expected back for some days. We have noted what has been happening in the sale of our goods and will await the account thereof, It is good to see that Dirck Thyssen has delivered to you the 324 bars of iron and the 20 barrels of steel on our account, and we also note the price at which you have sold the steel, but we are not happy to learn that some of the barrels were of such short weight. We will make enquiries here, as they were weighed at the works by our own people who have express orders always to ensure that, including the barrels, they weigh net 120 Ib. Danzigweight. We weigh it in this manner, as in Danzig, so that the barrels together with any excess weight have been paid for. See if they weighed it in this way in [London], or have weighed the steel only without the barrels, and please let me known for my future guidance. And as I have the opportunity to send a good deal of such steel (having that privilege from His Majesty) I beg you to let me know how large an amount you would be able to consume yearly so that I can employ my works accordingly.\n Inote that pitch and tar have fallen in price in [London]: I shall be glad to be kept informed of further developments. I have also noted the money you have remitted to Mr Caspar Bruyn, as well as the \u00a320 you have paid to Mr Johan Simons. I shall be grateful if you would help in every way, and if he should need another \u00a320 or \u00a330 please let him have it. Any money which you may have due to us, please make over to Caspar Bruyn as he will need some money on our account. Ihave already written to Mr Pelt Emanuels that he should place the money which Capt. Fix paid to you to our account. I trust he had done so and will not be writing to you about it any more as we have put his account right. We long to hear that Capt. Coomen, who is sailing to [London] from Gotland, has arrived safely and that his timber has found a good market. Our agent in Gotland tells us that it is very fine timber, and doubtless with the rebuilding of London a great deal of wood will be required. Please find out for us if some ships\u2019 lading of such balks and deals would sell on delivery and if one could get a good price for them, as we would gladly oblige. No one is ina better position to do so as we can have all the timber which Gotland produces in our hands. So please make inquiries and let us know what you think. We can have it cut to such lengths and breadths as people want, and the deals also, but you must write to us with the measurements\u2014and please find out if we are free to send them in Dutch ships. The 6 tuns of potash, which will be sent to you with the first available ship, are only an experiment, and if we perceive any profit in it we will send a larger amount. It is the same with the Gotland tar, which always costs more than Swedish tar. Do your best in all this as if it were for yourself, and let us have your detailed comments so that we can act accordingly. We have noted what you wrote about the kinds of iron which sell, and it is most instructive. With God\u2019s help we will provide you with a large amount in the spring. As my brother Jacob will not be living here regularly but will be spending most of his time at his brass-foundry in Norrk\u00e9ping, we have divided our trading, and what hitherto came from here please regard as mine only, unless it is expressly stated to belong to someone else\u2019s account. You will likewise get directions from me about what has, and will, come from Gotland, so from now on I will be writing to you in my own name and you can reply to me likewise so we can settle matters with one another. However, what you have just remitted to Amsterdam and have in your hands from here and Gotland is still in both our names. Farewell, &c.",

    "TEXT": "Our last letter was about a week ago, with which we remitted to you a bill of exchange for \u00a3166 9s 2d sterling for your account. Herewith goes the second copy in case the first is lost. Since then we have received your letter of the 20th past with the following remittances for the account of Mr Willem Momma at Nyk\u00e9ping, vizt.\n \u00a3240 at 345 4g, 2 usances, in your own bill on Nicholas Korf; \u00a380 as above, on Anselmus Hartsen;\n \u00a3100 as above, in a bill of Jean Dorville on Frederick Dorville; \u00a374 13s 4d at 34s 7g, 24 usances, in a bill of Daniel Porten on Joseph van Ast at Antwerp. We have secured acceptance of the first and also the last, and have informed Momma. The remittances were for the proceeds of the copper-wire out of Pieter Hartman and William Greene, of which we have made a note. We look forward to learning what else has occured in the sale of the remaining copper-wire and brass, though while the exchange is so very low please do not remit the proceeds. We must hope that the exchange improves; meanwhile, sell for the shortest time possible.\n As regards Nicholas Korf, he isa man of little credit and small business, who is not much to be relied on; we understand he is going to live in Rotterdam next month, for your information.\n We have received the bill of lading for the sugar shipped in John Goldsborough, but the invoice and the list of weights is not with it, so please let us have it. Concerning the freight, we will see if they will be satisfied with 4.000 Ib. net per last; ifnot, we must pay for the gross weight as is customary here.\n We see that you have recorded your agreement with the account of the sugar from Mackrel, but that the tare, short-weight and allowance for prompt payment takes away most of the profit. The tare of 15 per cent on big barrels and 16 on small is a customary condition here which it is useless to dispute; the 1 per cent for making good short weight has also been claimed by the sugar-refiners for some time and without it they will not offer a penny; and the 1 per cent for prompt payment is advantageous to the vendor if he otherwise has to wait three months for payment.\n The price of Barbados sugar remains still between 72g to 72g according to quality. We have had no news of James Hatton or of John Goldsborough, although as the wind is favourable we expect to have news of their arrival any day.\n Of the lead, we have only sold 50 pigs of the great lead from Anthony Winter to Jacob Charles at 28s 6g flem. with 1 per cent discount for payment within 3 weeks. There is no demand for small lead at the moment. We have written to our friend in Rotterdam to sell the 100 pigs of lead from Bywater as best he can but have had no answer. English tin is selling at f'so% but it is believed it will shortly fall to f-50 since, according to the latest letters which came from France three days ago, it seems there is again some hope of agreement being made with Spain. What foundation there is for this we shall see.\n We herewith forward Mr Hanson\u2019s answer to your letter. With heartiest regards, &c.",

You received the first and second copies of the bill of exchange for D.713, endorsed to you, together with the first for D.800 from Mr Chamberlain, of which the second endorsed copy has also been sent. You will know how to procure payment of the one and of the other. You have heard nothing of Capt. Carsten Pietersen\u2014may the Lord protect him! He should be leaving some money with you; how much, I shall expect to hear, so that I can know how much to debit you.\n I sce that the Levant ships and some Straits ships, together with one richly laden from Cadiz, have arrived with currants, which will make trade flourish. I look forward to hearing what you have done about my order to buy galls, as well as currants, for which you can lay out 43 to 445 for really sound goods. I can well believe that, before these voyages, the Levant trade was making very little profit.\n You received my order to lay out \u00a3300 to \u00a3400 on Barbados sugar and have bought 24 butts of very good quality at 28s, to be laden in [Capt.] Andries Rump. I look forward to hearing that it has been successfully completed, and to receiving the account and invoice. I wish very much that I had not given you my order to buy 2.000 |b. at Bristol for 26s now that you have bought for me in [London] at 28s, since the expense and risk between Bristol and [London] amounts to more than 2s per cwt. It would have been best if the price differed not less than 35 or 4s; so please revoke my order for that amount since no profit can be made by it, seeing that that commodity has also fallen here from 8\u00a2 to 73, 7 Or 7g according to quality. I see little prospect of it improving unless it rises in price in [London] and less comes from Barbados, as you believe.\n 40s per week fora big warehouse rental is too much money and too burdensome.

Herewith we send the account of both, together with an account of the 693 pieces of small lead from (Capt.] George Fowler. The net proceeds of the sugar amount to \u2018f.2676 17st; of the tin, to f-4674; and of the lead, to f.5753 1st 8g, all in bank money. Please check them, and, if you find no mistakes, make a record of them. The amount of sugar which has come to Zeeland from Surinam is not nearly as great as we had first been told, and seems to be about 400.000 Ib., as a result of which Barbados sugar is being maintained at 7g to 74g, but as the demand for refined sugar is small there is little prospect oft rising and we cannot guess what future prices can be obtained, so we wish you would consider it preferable to sell it in London.\n Great lead was selling in Rotterdam for 27s 6g flem. and it cannot be sold here for more than 28s at three months time. Since you have complained about the low price we have kept unsold what there is here and at Rotterdam. As for the small lead out of Henry Kirckhouse we have sold 100 pieces to Marten Van Lidt at 275 3g with 1 per cent discount for immediate payment. Since then, we have been offered only 27s at three months. We shall be glad to learn ifthe tin account answered your expectations. Various amounts have been sold at f'505, and if the expected East India ships bring no tin the price could well improve. You will have heard by now what the three East India ships which arrived here brought with them: we forgot to tell you in our last letter.\n We still cannot send you the sale-account of the 18 barrels of sugar in [Capt.] Mackrel since we have not settled with the captain yet. We find that some of the barrels in Mackrel, as well as in Goossen, do not weigh as much as they should according to the invoice. We suspect they have been tampered with by the sailors though we do not know any means of getting restitution as the barrels seem, to all appearances, intact. The captains will not admit to any knowledge of the reduced weight.\n We intended to remit you herewith all your proceeds, but have been unable to find satisfactory bills as so much moncy has been remitted to London today that the exchange has risen, as you can see below, so we remit you only:\n \u00a3700 sterling in a bill of Bartolotti & Rihel, to be received at 2 usances from Laurence Dibusty @ 345 115d;\n \u00a3168 125 4g, which is W.745 23s @ 544d, dated 6 April, drawn on Rudolf Lee, endorsed by us and reckoned at 34s 11g. Please procure their acceptance and credit us. As for the \u00a3100 sterling @ 35s 6g which you have remitted us on Dirck van Huisbergen due on the 4th instant, we shall procure payment and make youa return. We understand that Nicholas Korf has left for London. Your two drafts on him have been registered in the bank for us by his brother-in-law Barthout Ockers. This first is due in six days and the other before the departure of the post.\n We regret to sce the poor price of copper-wire and do not know how to advise you except to follow the orders of our friends in Sweden. The copper-wire from Norrk6ping is nearly as good as Hamburg wire and is now selling at f-55 per 100 lb. The \u2018Crowned N\u2019 variety is selling at f.54 so it is no use bringing it from here or from Hamburg at the price it is fetching with you. Although the amount which our Swedish friends have sent is too large, the kettles, pans, latten and other brassware ought to fetch a good price, seeing that the French have wrecked the brass-works round Aachen and chased away the workers. Jacob Momma advises us that a ship called St Jan Battista, Captain Claes Symons Schult, is being loaded for London in which he intends to send a good quantity of brass and iron. We were also glad to see that the amount coming here has not made the price weaken. In due course you will please make good the proceeds as Momma doubtless will instruct you. Herewith is one of his letters for you, with which our hearty regards, &c. \n&c.",

It is not the case that I wrote that the cannon-balls should come to London, nor was it ever my intention, and if it seems to say so in my letter of the 8th instant then it was badly copied, for the intention is that ifa good opportunity should arise at the place where the cannon-balls are lying to send them to Lisbon then it should not be neglected but taken at once. Iam glad to see that you have sold a quantity of iron. I shall not be able to send so much voyage iron this year, for it was only made at one forge and I ordered all of it to be sent to you, and as the forge was making other sorts of iron last winter there will probably not be so much. They write from Stockholm that iron is coming in rather slowly, so it may be rather late before the ships depart, and if there is a demand for what you already have, try to regulate consumption by concealing % or 5 of the quantity.\n Ihave been approached here about selling my share of the iron which was in the Stockholm, wrecked on the English coast.! They think to get it for 4 or 5 per cent, but I have disposed of it for one-third. If 1 decide otherwise I shall send someone from here to fish it up. Time will tell what further developments may follow.\n News has reached here from St Kitts that more than 2.000,000 Ib. of sugar has been destroyed by fire on Barbados and that few houses have been damaged. I hope it is not really so bad: may the Lord grant consolation for such a heavy affliction. Herewith Iremit you \u00a3221 5s@ 34s 10\u00a2 for your account. I have not yet had the account from Reval, but that can do no harm since the man must have money. I wish it was the same with that from Copenhagen, where I am lacking both the account and my money.

If you find them correct please make a record of it. The 65 RD from Baron Sparr! have not yet been received but they will be shortly and will then be placed to your credit. The \u00a330 you have paid to Mr Jan Simons has also been noted, and if he should want another \u00a330 or \u00a340 please let him have it and place it on my account. The schuit? which I am thinking of using for salvage work is now ready to sail. It is called the St Peter and the captain is Matthys Meyer. I have consigned her lading to you for my account as you will see from the enclosed bill of lading. May God protect her and bring her in safety! I rely on you to do your best to sell the goods. Among them are two bundles of bandiron, hammered not drawn, and I shall be glad to learn how well they sell. In Holland bandiron has sold at 23 to 3 per cent higher than fine bar-iron, and if it fetches a good price in [London] I am in a good position to have it made. I await your comments. I have read the detailed report which you have written to me about timber, which is instructive, but to charter as many ships as you suggest is hardly advisable as freight-rates are too high. However, I shall see what I can do. We are expecting two salt-ships at Gotland (may God bring them safely) and they will then be sent to [London] with timber. Meanwhile, keep me informed about what is happening to this commodity in [London]. Isce that you have sold the 16 lasts of Gotland tar at \u00a310 10s per last, which is a poor price. It may well be that it is not as highly esteemed in [London] as Stockholm tar, but in other places they give a good deal more for it than for what comes from here. To charter ships from [London] to here is not opportune as by now as many as 14 Setubal salt-ships are passing through the Sound from here and they all have consignments in them. Jan Juyst has paid me the \u00a367 tos for Jan Simons\u2019 bill of exchange, and I have credited your account.\n Isce you have been unable to get any buyers yet for the 6 tuns of potash. They were only sent as an experiment: please do your best with them and see how much they can fetch, for our future guidance. If it proves worthwhile we may send a further quantity. I note you to say that at least 6.000 houses are being built in [London], which must consume a great deal of timber. You also say that you think at least 1.000 to 1.500 lengths of Gotland beams at 40s per length and 20.000 to 25.000 deals at \u00a36 10s per hundred could be sold\u2014to which you await our decision. In answer I can only say that I cannot supply such a quantity while freight-rates are so high. However, we will see what we can do. My brother Jacob is in Gotland at present and has a ship-builder with him as we are thinking of having some fluyt-ships built there\u2014so with wood and timber-ware may God grant us fortune and His blessing!\n Meanwhile, keep me always informed about what is happening in [London] concerning timber-ware. I am glad to see that small-iron is now sought after in [London], because what I send is mostly of that sort. Keep me informed how each type is selling. That you have been able to get 15s [per cwt.] for our \u2018voyage\u2019 iron is good news. If I were certain that it could always sell like that I would have a large amount forged, so I shall await your opinion on this. Please also let me know how Setubal salt is selling in [London]. Isee that you have consulted with Jan Simons about the surety for the goods which are still in the wreck of the Stockholm and I note your opinion on the matter, which is helpful. | have written to Jan Simons at greater length in the enclosed letter. Please hand it to him and help him in every way, for which we will be most grateful.\n Thave not been able to get the schuit ready for use sooner, otherwise it would have left for [England] by now. God protect him and bring him in safety\u2014and then I hope something may be achieved this summer, as time will tell.\n Ihave loaded for my account in the Deensche Pheenix, which will be ready in a few days: \nSlb. 884.12 various sorts of fine bar-iron; Slb. 263.6 \u2014_ rod-iron; 106 casks of steel in tall casks; 52 ditto in flat casks; 834 dozen long deals, to complete the cargo,\nall of which is consigned to you. The bill of lading will be sent with my next letter, and when the ship arrives in [London] I beg you to unload it as soon as possible and speed it on its way to St Ubes in ballast as it has also been chartered by Mr P\u00e9tter as usual so that it can complete its journey before the winter. Please help the captain, who is Claus Willman, in every way, and we will be most grateful.\n I have ordered these goods, as well as those in the schuit, St Peter to be insured by Peter Simons in Amsterdam. I hope to God the premium will be justified. Since I have charged him with some bills of exchange which are going to fall due soon, I have written to tell him to correspond with you and to draw on you for my account; and if some misfortune should overtake the goods (which God forbid!) you could draw on him in return as he will have had them insured. And I would like you to allow Mr Simons to draw on you nine or ten thousand rixdollars. Please accommodate him. The interest on what you advance will be made good, and I shall shortly be sending you more goods of which you will be advised. Your letters of the 15th and 22nd of May to my brother Jacob have been received in his absence, and \u2014following his instructions\u2014I have opened them and read their contents. I am delighted to see that Capt. Erick Erickson has arrived. God be thanked for his blessings! As to the money you have advanced on his goods\u2014he will gladly make it good, regarding $ per cent per month interest as cheap. It is good that you have told Mr Hiebenaer that he may draw on you up to 8.000 RD, and if it does not inconvenience you, you could, according to your offer, remit the remainder to Messrs Van Baerle as it is more profitable for my brother. He will make good the interest on what you advance.\n However, I am not happy to see that the price of copper-wire is so low, and I hope it will improve. Here copper prices are rising as the copper mine is producing little because of some roof-falls which have occurred. I shall inform my brother of what you write about the various sorts of wire, and I shall be glad to learn to whom the 1.650 coils of wire from Cock have come. As for my brother\u2019s affairs, I hope he will have returned home in a month or six weeks time. Your enclosure to Mr Hegerstiern* came to me under the cover of Mr Caspar Bruyn\u2019s and was accidentally opened in the presence of two good friends. Nothing in it was read, but it was sealed up again and sent to his house where he opened it and then sealed it again and returns it to you again. In future, please do not.send him any letters under cover to me or Mr Bruyn. Wherewith, regards, &c.",

    "TEXT": "Our last letter was about a week ago with the account of 200 pieces of great lead in [Capt.] James Hatton and a remittance of W.2500 at 1024 on Paris, of which the second copy is enclosed, We have since received your letter of the 17th past, from which we see that Mr Jacob Momma has asked you to remit us some money and that he will agree the interest with you\u2014about which you await our opinion. To which we answer that we find it more profitable for Momma and more convenient for us to draw on you at double usance, as we wrote previously, and therefore beg you to make no remittances unless something is rebated and paid down by the purchasers or unless the exchange rises higher in the near future. You will charge Momma 6 per cent per annum interest on the money you advance on account of his goods (as is provided in our contract with him) making good our share. We trust you do not find it strange that we enjoy some profit thereby, because after all we advance the full value of the goods without having them in our hands. Nevertheless, if you think 43 per cent to be too little interest, you can deduct 5 per cent and leave us to enjoy 1 per cent. Please do not betray this to Momma, so that he is given no grounds for allowing us less than the 6 per cent stipulated.\n About six weeks ago, 20 chests of small copper bars were sent to Isbrant van Holten at Elsinore, to be consigned to you from there. The proceeds of this are also to be at our disposal and we will be glad to learn of its arrival. We have procured acceptance of the \u00a3 100 at 35s 7g double usance on Peter Dorville. We shall retain the bill of exchange here in case you place it to Momma\u2019s account and endorse the second copy to us. We have today drawn on you, for the same account, \u00a3600, namely:\n\u00a3200) at 2 usances, payable to Joos and Jan Debats ipa or order, value of themselves; \u00a3200) at 2 usances, payable to Michael Block or jae order, the value of himself.\nWe entrust to you the honour of our bills. We find we have not remitted to you the full amount of your proceeds, so we herewith remit you our first bill of 7.500 in a bill of Jean des Planches to receive at 2 usances from Thomas Legendre the younger at Rouen negotiated at 102g per W. for which you will please credit us. The exchange on France remains firm, as money is scarce there, so we believe you would do well to remit your money there. Of your lead we have just sold 100 pieces of small lead to Jacob Charles at 25s payable in 3 months. Great lead is selling at 25s 8-6g. Sugar is weakening, good Barbados selling at 63g. From [Capt.] John Clarke and Marten Bilke we have heard nothing because of contrary winds. We are now in the deadest season of the year and believe it would be better to hold back the sugar, on which we will be glad to have your opinion. We will be glad to see that you have sold the campeachy wood, following our advice, since it has weakened here to about f.17. For English tin blocks one cannot get more than f.50; Apulian oil \u00a360 to \u00a361 flems.; Swedish garcopper has risen from f.553 to f-56; large plates f.58; sheet copper [635 to f.64; copper bars f-64; otherwise little change in Swedish commodities.

It would be better next time to sell itat \u00a313 10s for time, and my idea was to dispose of only a little in the hope that square iron would soon be in demand since so little has been sent. You should know best whether there is much square iron around in your area, and if so, you should be able to judge how much to withhold. I rely on you in this to do as you think advisable. I do not quite understand your intention\u2014that is, whether you meant to sell it for cash or to barter it for tin and account for it as if the tin had been paid for in cash. Ifit should be paid for in tin you can send it over here straight away, but please make sure that it is smelted cleanly and not with coal, as it is presently ata rather low price and people are rather choosy!\u2014and if it is pure one immediately has an advantage in selling it. You must do this for the square iron but not for the flat iron, unless there is only a little flat iron remaining, for if one should reckon 8o tons of square and 20 tons of flat at an average of \u00a313 per ton then the square iron would work out at scarcely \u00a3124 per ton, since flat iron is worth so much more than \u00a313 per ton. According to my best recollection there must be still about 3.000 bars of flat iron, though I may be mistaken as Iam in no position here to check it, Please reflect on this and do what you judge suitable. You should also take into consideration that, by all appearances, not more than 2.000 slb of \u2018O\u2019 and \u2018G\u2019 flat iron can be expected, apart from the voyage iron\u2014that is, if Bex despatched in one ship the rest of the iron he was ordered to send here.\n IFT gave \u00a36 per ton for what is to come from Barbados I would be obliged to load the whole ship, or else he would have to look around for the rest of his lading and I would have to make up for what falls short, or else be responsible for a share of his cargo. It is strange that Abcels has not written to advise us how things stand over there, for our guidance. Since itis rather late for the Pyper to go to Sweden, it is best that he goes to La Rochelle or Bordeaux for the vendange, for unless some other good opportunity arises I am confident he will get a good return at Bordeaux.

Herein we send the bills of lading for Jolle T Jerdts and Jacob Jacobsen Grys, also consigned to you, the first of which having 52 lasts 8 tuns of tar and 17 lasts of pitch, the other having 73 lasts 11 tuns of tar and 20 lasts of pitch. May the Lord guide them also! Captains Elias Johansen and Hans Johansen have also been chartered: the first is now loading and the other will begin shortly. We had written this far when we got your letter of the 31st of July with which came a copy of the contract which you and Mr Thuen have made together concerning our Company\u2019s business, Through a lack of time we cannot read it over, and we will let you know what we think of it by our next. You say that you want us to send 550 lasts of tar and 120 lasts of pitch to [London], and the rest of the 700 lasts of tar and 200 of pitch to Hull, Yarmouth and the Isle of Wight. You will sce from the bills of lading how much we have so far sent to [London], being in all 432 lasts 1 tun of tar and 144 lasts of pitch. In addition, as we have just said, Elias Johansen is loading and Hans Johansen has been chartered, so you can expect to get the requested amount of tar at [London] and a good deal more than the requested amount of pitch. But as regards the amounts requested for other places such as Hull, Yarmouth and the Isle of Wight, we fear we will find no shipping going there, but we will do our best and let you know what we arrange. Concerning insurance and cash advances, we refer you to our previous letter, not doubting that whenever our goods arrive you will, according to contract, advance the money, and we request you to correspond with Mr Simons about this as we said in the copy above. Meanwhile we are very glad to hear of the arrival of Capt. Hans Tennissen: may the Lord God be thanked who with His gracious help may have since brought the others in safety, as they followed him shortly after. We expect to hear soon. If we are going to insure the ships still lying here off-shore we will advise you, closing this with cordial regards, &c.",

    "TEXT": "My last letter to you was on the 25th, to which I refer you. As I have not heard from you this serves only to say that Captain Anders Beursen arrived here some days ago and tells me that the 450 slb of voyage iron which I last consigned to you aboard him was sold as soon as it landed, which is good.\n Since then, we have had so little water inland that we could not get any voyage iron, but we have now had so much rain that water is very abundant and we have now got over 300 slb from up-country. Anders Beursen only has 100 slb aboard him, but the rest will go together in his ship which you can expect in due course. I have seen some Englishmen here who would gladly buy this consignment from me, but we could not agree. Someone called David Matson bought a quantity from me some time ago and shipped it to England. Samuel Rutter writes to me that in addition to the \u00a385, he has paid out to you \u00a3154 8s 6d for my account, which I hope you will have remitted to Mr Bex before receiving this, as well as anything which arises from the sale of my iron.\n[P.S.] Monsicur Marescoe, before closing this I received yours of the 21st and 25th past by which I learn that you had only sold 2 of the iron received from Anders. I have no doubt that you will have sold the rest since then. From the English here I have had many requests for voyage iron, but to prevent it coming into too many hands I shall not sell. 1 am glad to see that you have remitted \u00a3350 to Mr Bex for my account at 35s 6g, double usance. I have also made a note on the account concerning Samuel Rutter. Rutter has sent me, via Anders Beursen, an account of the ship\u2019s sale and other matters between us. He is an experienced and good seaman to whom one may safely entrust a ship. It is a good thing he is now free from Cuttler, who must be an unscrupulous person. May God protect me from the like!

If they are choice, I shall be glad, and hope to learn by your next in whom they have been shipped. You were unable to achieve anything regarding sugar. If, with the arrival of future shipments, it should faller lower and you judge the price to be at its lowest, then buy me 12.000 to 15.000 lb., but it is no use to me if it costs more than 26s, and it must be choice stuff, because there is plenty here and I must have only the very choicest, choice quality. Always bear that in mind when buying for me. The ships from Scanderoon have arrived and in your opinion galls are at their lowest. If you can get 20 barrels for less than sos make sure the galls are big, heavy and blue. Aleppo galls are also welcome here. Camphor is regarded asa drug; it comes in little tubs, looks like snow but when refined is like crystal and at present fetches here 4o stuivers unrefined and so stuivers refined. If what they call camphor in [England] can be had for 6 to 10s it must be something else, so if possible send me a sample of the raw commodity for my guidance. If it can be brought here for less than 40 stuivers I would buy 500 Ib. It is also used for perfume.\n Sir, I would like to have 2.000 to 3.000 lb. of syrup from [London], but syrup is not allowed to be imported here unless it pays 1 stuiver per lb. To avoid that, I should like to ask you to get 2 empty pipes of oil that have been boiled clean and firmly reinforced with hoops so that they do not leak. Fill them up with syrup and firmly close up the tops with nails so they cannot be opened. They should get in safely, and I would then give you a good commission, but they must be kept steady and above all the casks must be thick so that they do not discover by leakage that it is not oil inside. Also, in shipping them you must not give the captain to understand that there is anything but oil inside, and on the bill of lading put down that they are to deliver these pipes to Hay t\u2019Yercks marking them HTY in case of any unexpected hitch, although do not make any difficulty about the manner in which it is done. If there is any new English saffron in [London] please send me a sample and the price, and please mention how much the enclosed sample of indigo would fetch in [England]. If there is anything in which I can be of service, please command me\u2014with God\u2019s blessing, &c. \n[P.S.] This sample is refined camphor, only I have ground it up in order to enclose it: otherwise it comes in lumps, for your information.",

I see that you and Mr Hendrick Thuen drank my health ina glass of wine: thank you for your kind remembrance of me, and as soon as Hendrick Thuen comes home again we shall drink your health in return. I see that Mr Thuen has been establishing a secure business for the Tar Company in [England], in which he will use you\u2014which I am very happy to learn. It would be a good thing if our company could at last be put on a firm footing so that we could for once be allowed to enjoy some profits, which could be achieved with good management. I hope that Mr Thuen has put things in good order in [England], as well as in Holland and other places. Thank you for your kind offer to serve me whenever I have any goods to send, which I will accept. I cannot overlook you since you have served me so well in the past, which encourages me to employ you further\u2014and I would have done so already ifit were not that iron has been at so low a price in [England] that I and others have been frightened off from sending any iron to [England]. For at \u00a3124 and \u00a313 per ton there is nothing to be done: it must fetch \u00a314 to \u00a315, and then I might have something to send. I see that broad iron is fetching the highest price. It is important that I should know which kinds of iron are in most demand and fetch the most money, so that I can have them made at my works. If 1 knew what price anchors were at in [England] I could yearly send you 100 to 200 slb. Here they cost 30 to 32 copper dollars per shippound. I have about 80 slb of large anchor-flukes lying here, which I cannot easily sell. If 1 could sell them in [England] I would send them to you\u2014to which I await your reply.\n I and some other friends have decided to carry on an iron-works located in Varmland which can produce 2.000 to 3.000 slb of iron yearly and likewise 100 to 200 slb of copper at the least. If the mine were extended it could well produce 300 to 500 slb of copper, but I cannot guarantee so large an amount until we see how the mine turns out, which one can do better when it is working. We will send the iron and copper to Gothenburg. When the works are in operation I shall probably have need of 3.000 to 5.000 RD at a low rate of interest. If you were willing to accommodate me I could ensure that you receive large commissions. Please send me your views on this as soon as possible, as well as the price of anchors and bariron. If | see any profit in them I shall send you some in the Spring. I look forward to your answer on all this, with cordial greetings, &c.",

Please continue to give surety for the ship and I will supply a collateral guarantee, not doubting that the company will save us harmless.

We decided on this as we see little prospect of it doing better, as there are at present over 1.000 pieces in town unsold, and there will shortly be a quantity coming with the fish-ships, probably before the Europa reaches Leghorn. So we were of the opinion it was more likely to fall than otherwise.

The rest is to follow next week, and we hope to be able to send the account by our next letter. Pepper was selling at 150 ducats at 2 months time and is still being held at that price. Good quality cinnamon is at 108 dollars (poor quality is unsaleable), cloves at 65 dollars, sappanwood at 70 ducats with 4 months time. Otherwise no changes of any importance.",

I wrote to him at length three weeks ago about what he claims and sent him an account, allowing him what is due for his trouble. You can always open his letters to me, as well as mine to him, if you want to: they were only sealed in order to spare you any trouble, and if they were left open you would be able to judge the facts for yourself, inasmuch as the letters are sometimes lengthy over small points of trade-accounts.\n Tam glad that you are writing at once to Londonderry via Dublin, for I cannot understand what is hindering me from getting letters from there.\n I do not know if] sent you the invoice of the iron in the Beer, or a note accompanying that for the Halve Maen, saying that it is an old Swedish ship.

We hope to remit you the remainder by our next. We have made a note of the 20 sacks of pepper laden for your account in the ships Gratia and Vrede, departing from Amsterdam, and of the 100 pieces of lead on the William & Elizabeth, half for your account and half for your brother-inlaw, Mr John Lethicullier, from whom we have received the bill of lading. May the Lord bring them in safety. We shall not fail to press for the highest price possible. Lead is now offered at D.50 on delivery and for prompt delivery at D.503, but falling, for there are daily more enticements to buy so that I fear there will be a further decline as this is also the deadest season of the year for sales. Pepper is still being held at D.150, because there is not much in town. If the Gratia arrives early I still hope to find a good market, but with one thing and another I may not be able to do such good business. The Lantsman, according to the latest letters, has not yet arrived at Leghorn\u2014I mean, Ancona. Indeed, he delays too long and [-- - -| must be taken. May the Lord protect him from mishap. Likewise with the Enropa, whose departure from Leghorn you will have seen in my last letter. As for the sale of lead, I cannot say if it has been well done so far because, as yet, there is no better prospect to be hoped for. If it should increase further in England it may well go the same way here: one must hope so. As for that which has just been laden in Amsterdam, and which will have to fetch a better price if it is not to produce a loss, I assure you that it will be dealt with as if it were my own. English tin still remains here at the price of D.32 per hundred-weight (corresponding to that of lead). If not too much more arrives we are of the opinion that it will remain at that price, Zante currants were being held at R. pta. 40, Cephalonian at R. pta. 35 to the first buyer, with the likelihood of not falling as there are still two or three ships to go there to load. It will be possible to lade the new Apulian oil next month at D.134 per salm, for casks on board. The Jolin & Thomas departed last Monday.

I now find myself owing you an answer to your letters of the oth, 23rd and 30th of October\u2014but that of the 16th, in which you sent the account of the 1.064 coils of wire, 76 chests of copper bars and 349 Hungary plates, has not yet come to my hand, so I shall await a copy as well as a sale-account of the above-mentioned goods. I have received the account of the 50 cases of stecl: I shall check it and debit you accordingly. It is very welcome news that Petersen Muller has arrived safely. I hope the other two ships from Gotland will also arrive soon and that their timber will find a good market.\n I sce that Jacob Grys is not permitted to unload his pitch and tar in [London]: for what reason, I would very gladly learn. I saw also that you were offered \u00a35 16s for the remaining latten and that you sold it for \u00a35 18s. I urge you to you to do your best for my brass and copper as if it were your own and that, if possible, you get it sold before the winter, because I can send a new lot in the spring. With the remaining bars you should bide your time and take care only to dispose of the small parcel of copper-wire rods. It is good garcopper of a kind which you can no longer get and without it one cannot make bars. I hope it will sell well. As all the ships are going to [Guinea?] it is not advisable to sell the bars at \u00a35 15s or even \u00a36. Itis better to bide your time. I have noted what is happening to iron. You have now paid all the drafts from the Messrs Van Baerle. I would like a clear statement of how much you think you will have at your disposal on my account from now on, for my information.\n The sample of kettles which you sent with Matthys Meyer has not yet appeared in Stockholm. As soon as they arrive I shall let you know whether or not I can get them made, though I think I can, and you will have my thanks. I want to know how much they cost and I will place it to your credit. At 7s per cwt. the calamine is no use to me. You can expect two more ships from Gotland laden with beams and planks. They will also have a quantity of sandstone of the kind we use in this country to ornament our houses as chimney-pieces or fireplaces. I have ordered the captains to take it aboard as ballast beneath the timber. If there is anything to be done with it I could deliver a great quantity. It was selling in Holland by the foot at 18, 19 and 20 stuivers per square foot, but while freight-rates are so high one cannot get as much for it as one ought, for it should cost at least 25 to 26 stuivers per foot. I shall be glad to learn what happens. If there should be any major buildings, such as churches or mansions, being constructed in [London] and if one could make a contract for a large quantity I would agree to it even if it were for as much as 30 or 40 ship-loads, provided that they unload it. I could supply it, free-on-board, at 12 RD per 100 square feet and at [London] sell the best at 2 RD, provided that the buyer paid for the importing and expenses in [London]. You could look into it with this trial offer and Iet me know your views.\n Thear that large amounts of sheet-iron are being forged in Hamburg this ycar and sent to [London]. I beg you to let me know how much it may be selling for, what size and weight it is, and if further amounts are being demanded, for I could deliver a good quantity if there were some profit to be made by it. And I want you also to inquire if it has been decided in [England] to have a copper coinage made, and if so, whether one could not deliver a quantity of copper blanks. Please find out, in secret, and let me know about it. One could earn a substantial commission on a commodity like that. Wherewith, my heartiest regards, &c.",

I hope it will not happen, but if it should I herewith give you orders to spend something on procuring its freedom to be imported and unloaded, so that they can be sold. It must not be risked with a severe freeze-up; just wait long enough until something is decided, in case it does not freeze at all. There are 250 chests altogether, with the accompanying mark, loaded aboard the ship St Jean Battista, master Joost Clacsens, a Hamburger. In each case there are about 400 to 500, according to their size, and they are of a size which one usually sells here at RD 9-10 per case, for your guidance.

    "TEXT": "Fourteen days ago, on the 28th of November, was my last letter to you, which was brief and mainly to accompany the bill of lading of SIb. 160.19.11 of wire and Slb. 31.5.13 of Hungary plates consigned to you aboard Gerret Laurens, which I hope you have received. Since then the ship has departed and as it had a following wind I hope, with God\u2019s help, it has arrived in [England]. Furthermore, Mr Hansen has returned from England, assuring me that you have shown yourself very favourably inclined to administer my affairs over there, and as I should be very glad to see all the Swedish commissions together in one hand I have asked him to send you my views and the conditions on which I want to correspond,\" I trust he has done so and that you have accepted them, for none of my friends in Holland, Hamburg and France refuse them. And although I have addressed a consignment to you before I can receive your answer, I trust that I shall nonetheless be treated generously by you, which will give me grounds for continuing with even bigger commissions.\n You yourself know that at these miserable prices for wire there are losses, but that if it all came into one person\u2019s hands it could be held in better esteem. I beg you to do this, and not to let it go for less than \u00a35 12s or \u00a35 10s. As for [copper] plate, since it usually fetches a good price, please sell it at the current price because I do not doubt it will be fixed at \u00a36 ros. Let the captain keep the bill of lading if he has it, but the other, endorsed by me, is to be handed over; and have the empty casks of steel delivered to Messrs Burkin & Evertsen. It would be friendly service to me if one could, quietly and securely, conclude an agreement with the East India Company for a considerable quantity of copper. Tell me what you think, in confidence, and also what you have heard from the Resident, Leyonbergh, about my case concerning the plundered galliot called de Paerel\u2014whether anything is coming of it or not. You could easily inquire and assure yourself that it is being handled as it should be, I await your advice concerning the prices of our Swedish commodities and your counsel concerning next Spring\u2019s cargoes, and send herewith, cordial greetings, &c. \n[P.S.] In my last letter I ordered you to insure the goods aboard Gerret Laurens for 8.000 RD. I hope that has been done; if not, please have it done without delay.",

This letter serves mainly to say that I have, lying here in Slite harbour, two Dutch ships which came from Portugal with salt. The ships are called De Hartogh (of which Claes Jacobs is captain) and the St Margreta (captain, Cornelis Jacobsen) and I am having them loaded with timber, such as large and small beams, planks and firewood. I am also putting some limestone inas ballast, just as an experiment. Very fine lime can be burned. You could enquire if there is any chance of selling it: for your information, one can get three tons of lime from one ton of limestone. You will be hearing from Mr Jacob Kroes how much it costs. As for the timber which is coming in the above-mentioned ships, you will find it much better timber than any from the Baltic or Norway. Indeed, an English builder assured me that it was as good as any northern or Dutch oak. You will find it to be mostly of large beams, over one foot thick in diameter, so Iam hopeful it will sell for much more than it did last year. Iam relying on you to do your utmost with them.\n Jam also expecting at Klintchamn two large ships from Holland which will also be loaded for [London] with extremely fine timber. They will be consigned to you and I do not doubt that you will seck my profit. Please pay the freight charges to the aforesaid captains according to the account which Jacob Kroes will send you if he writes to you. If the timber-ware should fall short of the balance due on the freight (which I hope it will not) I shall make provision for you from Sweden, I am relying on you, and if the timber sells well and if Dutch ships can freely come to [England] with such goods next year Iam thinking of sending 10 to 12 shipslading of timber. May the Lord God grant you good health, &c. \n[P.S.] I should like to know how much corn sells for in [London], what the expenses are and how the measures compare with Dutch measures, as I am expecting 800 to 900 lasts of grain on Osel this autumn. If there is anything to be done with it through you or elsewhere I could deliver a substantial amount.",

    "TEXT": "Since our latest letter of the 28th past we have received yours of the 13th ditto, which we ought to have had eight days earlier. This week\u2019s ordinary post has also not arrived. We have noted that Resident Leyonbergh has been unable to achieve anything, although he has done his duty in trying to procure freedom for the ships, and that captain Johanson was ready to depart for Rochelle although the Resident still had hopes of obtaining his freedom, which would be very welcome to us as we would rather not send the goods to Rochelle where there is already so much that they will not be sold for a long while. It is a good thing that you are summoning the St Pieter from Yarmouth, because our friends from Hull and Yarmouth have written that so much tar and pitch from others has arrived that it will not be sold in a year. We beg you to seize every opportunity to dispose of our goods at whatever price they will fetch so that foreign competitors are thwarted and not allowed to dominate the market. We shall now wait to hear of further developments. From the accompanying extract you will be able to see how much Mr Simons has accepted for us and when the amounts fall due. We have made out a short account showing how much we can draw on you according to contract against the goods we have sent you, being in total 404 lasts and 6 barrels of tar and 170 lasts and 8 barrels of pitch (besides the three consignments which have to go to Rochelle and with which you can now no longer be ofany service to us) rated according to contract at \u00a35 per last for the tar and \u00a38 per last for the pitch, making a total of \u00a33.384 from which is deducted the \u00a31.300 which Simons has already drawn. That leaves \u00a32.084 to be made good, followed by the \u00a32.000 which you have promised to furnish in the spring, altogether totalling \u00a34.084 which we have ordered Mr Simons to draw on you in the month of February next or whenever the said bills fall due at 2 or 4 usances. We beg you to be so kind as to accept his drafts for that amount and we trust that the goods will easily yield that much and more\u2014but in case they do not we shall save you from any loss by sending you at the first opportunity in the new year a sufficient quantity from which you can reimburse yourself. We await your favourable response to this, never doubting in the least that you will assist us, and request that you correspond with Mr Simons about it. In the meanwhile may God bless and protect you.\n[P.S.] The moment we finished this we immediately received your letter of the 2oth past with the sale account of goods from Hans Teunissen and Alexander Davidson which we will have checked over, let you know our findings and then record our agreement. We were sorry to see that Lord Leyonbergh was unable to procure freedom for the ships and that the Beata and St Anna have also departed for Rochelle. We greatly regret that. We had always had high hopes that their freedom would be obtained. These hopes are now dashed. We had also hoped to have the benefit of the proceeds, but that also cannot be done, so we beg you to honour our drafts of \u00a34.084 according to plan. You said you had to guarantee security of \u00a32.000 for the Suyderstrom and asked us not to draw anything against it. We hope\u2014and recently we have had assurance\u2014that its freedom will be obtained, and the captain also writes that ship and goods could be freed on payment of \u00a3150. Nevertheless, we shall guarantee you against any loss and provide your collateral security. The Salt Company will do likewise for their share of the ship and goods. It is good that the cargo from Jolle Tiersen has been mostly sold and that you can see your way to disposing of the remainder from the Suyderstrom. Please sell it for whatever it will fetch. God willing, we shall send you a consignment as soon as the waters are open again and in order to do so have already chartered all the necessary ships. With regard to the matter of the court-judgement we shall see what happens. We shall also see to it that the Resident gets another letter to spur him on which we hope to send with the next post, remaining meanwhile, &c. [enclosed bill removed]",

    "TEXT": "My latest letter to you was on the 29th past and since then I have heard nothing from you. This serves to inform you that in September last I loaded in the Phoenix (Capt. Robert Clark, an Englishman) bound from here to Venice, 10 bales of pepper, bearing the mark adjoining, and 512 pieces of campeachy wood which weighed here 15.733 lb., as well as a quantity of iron cannon-balls. I now learn that the said captain struck on the Goodwins and, having suffered some damage, ran into Dover where he unloaded the whole ship and wrote to the interested parties here asking for remittance of his expenses, which it is said will run high. So my request to you asa friend is, that you will immediately write to your friend at Dover to discover what costs he has incurred and to urge him to have some regard for my goods. As for paying the costs of unloading and reloading, that can hardly be done unless a proper division is made, and I would judge it best that the captain tries to borrow the money and leaves the division of costs until he has delivered in Venice. Meanwhile, since it will be undoubtedly a long voyage and I understand that pepper is fetching high prices in England I would be glad to see you receive the 10 bales of pepper and also the campeachy wood lying at Dover, agreeing with the captain for half the freight or, failing that, paying the whole freight and keeping the expenses as low as possible. And if you can sell the pepper for 23d or 24d [p. lb. and the campeachy wood at about 50s [p. cwt.] please do it, and also find out how much that type of cannon-ball fetches in England. I am sending you herewith the bill of lading, the endorsement left blank, as well as a letter to a passenger and friend of the captain and owners who is now on the ship, called Henrig de Valet, who I am urging to persuade the captain to follow your advice in all matters, as I trust he will do. There was also loaded here in the said ship a small barrel of cardamon marked \u2018P.B.\u2019 which the captain said, on signing the bill of lading, he had not found. Please inquire if it has now been found in the process of unloading; if so, it can be sent on to Venice. I beg you to forgive me for giving you this trouble, and please do your best to serve me, urging your trusted friend at Dover neither to lose the bill of lading nor to fill it in before it is known what the captain will allow to be done with the goods. I am also sending herewith the bill of lading for the cannon-balls in case you need it and it seems a good idea not to reload them. I know very well that such goods as pepper and [campeachy] wood are not allowed to be imported into England from here; however, I hope that in this regard no notice will be taken and that you will know just how far one can go. Sir, as I found the cotton you sent reasonably good, excepting one bag which was very dirty inside, I herewith request you that if there is no prospect of further decline in that sort you will, at your convenience, look for similarly good cotton and if you can encounter a quantity which is clean and white to be had for 6d to 64d then get me another 15 to 20 sacks of Smyrna, as well as 10 of Cyprus, cotton\u2014and if such clean and white stuff is to be had at 65d or 62d please buy it and send it at the first opportunity in the spring. Above all, you must procure good quality, which can be done very conveniently since there is no prospect of a price rise. I can see no opportunity here for poor quality, for your information.",

Anders Beursen\u2019s arrival with my iron, which doubtless has been correctly delivered.\n When I mentioned increased costs in my letters I was not referring to ordinary expenses such as brokerage and suchlike, but was thinking that I shall have to carry the costs of selling goods to reliable people and bear the discount on good money\u2014that is to say, quaet gelt.. I will gladly bear any loss, whether it arises in [England] or here, and I understand perfectly well the difference between exchange and current money. If my goods were sold on such terms I must be satisfied with them. Regarding the sale of my iron with a rebate of 8 per cent\u2014I will gladly grant that, if you will stand liable for bad debts, but I think it is too risky for me to bear bad debts in return for 6 per cent rebate on goods sold at 6 months time. God knows, I have had my share of bad debts in [London] and the effects of the great Fire of [London] begin to emerge now as in cases such as Scherley? and may yet be revealed more fully with time. Consequently, one must be careful to whom one sells. The \u00a3150 @ 35s 10g on Amsterdam remitted to Mr Bex for my account on 2 October at double usance drawn on John Lodge & Co has been accepted. I trust payment will follow, for which I have credited your account.\n I urge you to sell my iron which has come with Beursen to reliable people. As there is no fitting-out taking place in [England]? demand is very small, so one must wait and see. I have had a lot of inquiries after Beursen\u2019s iron from the English here but I did not want to let it get into other hands. Please let me know in due course how things turn out with Scherley. Our Company is owed quite a lot, as you well know, which the partners find strange. Tam thinking of travelling up-country at the earliest opportunity and expect to stay there for some time.

Because no special occasion has presented itself I have not written to you since then but I have meanwhile received yours of 24 December and of 22 [January], in answer to which the ship St_Jan Battista, of which you wrote, has since arrived in the Texel with this favourable wind and the cargo has come to a profitable market at Amsterdam, for which God must be thanked, for I was nota little afraid that it would be frozen in. For the last 14 days the ice has been melting so that the Elbe is nearly entirely free of it, and yesterday the mussel-fishers started coming up again. Ihave been glad to see what Barbados sugar has been doing [in London]. The price of 27s is still too high for me and since it seems likely to rise in [England] there is nothing to be done with it here in the near future because there are too large amounts in too many hands of people who would be glad to sell at 62 to 63g. But little is disposed of because our leading sugar-refiners provided themselves before the winter with such large stocks that for 6 months or more there will be no shortage. Consequently, unless its price weakens in [London] there will be few orders from Amsterdam or from here. However, if it should show signs of falling to 245 or 245 6d please buy 15.000 to 20.000 Ib. and send it to me. If you draw on me for the requisite funds at once, due honour will be done to your bills, but above all see to it that it is dry and white or else leave it alone, for dirty, clammy stuff is of no use to me. Despite cotton being so cheap with you it would not be advisable for it to come here as there is no demand for it. Oil was falling to \u00a329 with you: if you can get some clear, sweet Apulian oil which has freshly arrived you can buy me 6 or 7 barrels, but take good care that there is no dirt in itand that there has been nothing strong or bitter-tasting in the casks before. I would prefer you to buy the best barrels, of 140 to 150 gallons, and send them here as above at the first opportunity. Galls here are at 42 to 43 ML @ 13 months time. 60s for them in [London] is too high. Large quantities have reached Marseille and they are cheap there so I consider that those in London are as high as they will be. Wherewith I commend you to God\u2019s protection, &c.",

We shall postpone drawing on you for J.M.\u2019s account until next month and then not more than \u00a3500 to \u00a3600 sterling in all, and if we can manage it we shall entirely forego drawing and expect you at your convenience to make remittances for our friends in good bills. However, it is very awkward for us to be out of pocket for so long on account of the money we have advanced upon these goods since the amount is so large.\n Herewith goes the account of the 40 barrels of tin received with Simon van Houten, of which the net proceeds amount to f.6.196.12s bank-money. We have placed it to your current account. Please check it over and if you find no errors please approve it. We will not sell your remaining tin for less than f.58 until further order. So far no buyers have come forward for the galls although we have several times commissioned brokers. We shall continue to do so whenever we see the Opportunity.\n We have made inquiry with Peter Simons\u2019 book-keeper as well as in the Bank to learn if the \u00a3250 sterling bill of exchange of 1/11 January at 36s with double usance drawn by you for the benefit of Jacob Cornelisen and endorsed to Widow Forkenbeck had been enrolled as he said it had been when he wrote to you on the 12th inst., but from both we received the answer that it had not been done. So, according to your request, we have today paid the sam to the aforesaid Widow Forkenbeck by declaration before a notary that it had been done for the honour of the drawer, as appears in the deed accompanying the bill of exchange and protest sent herewith, amounting with interest and expenses (according to the enclosed account from Forckenbeck) to: f.2.708.16.00\nfor a copy of the protest and deed for the honour of the drawer: 2.03.00 for our commission on the re-draft and brokerage: 10.03.08 f2.721.01.08\nWe have today drawn on you \u00a3256 2s 6d sterling, payable at 2 usances to Gerard Weymans, the value of Michiel Gerard junior, which you will please honour and set against the aforesaid amount. We have also told Abraham Bex and Jan Aries Snoeck that we will pay the \u00a3110 @ 36s 3g and the \u00a344 4s 4d @ 36s on the date due, for which amount with expenses we will also draw on you. The above-mentioned Simons has left for Sweden and has written to someone that he will be back within two months and will give everyone satisfaction. We too were of the opinion that he did no business on his own account but we now find it was otherwise and that he carried on a trade with Portugal, as well as with Sweden, in salt. In addition, during the war, he had taken shares in various Swedish ships with all of which he made no profit. Yet he has advanced about f. 100.000 to various people in Sweden, for which he expected goods in the spring, and as he had no means of his own he had to use other people\u2019s money; and a broker whom he was accustomed to use failing not long ago several amounts were called in and seeing that he could get no credit to make good the amounts which were drawn by him on Frankfort (being about 44.000) he decided to depart. His outstanding loans and assets nearly balance his liabilities, being about 200.000, but in the latest letters from Sweden it is said he has had orders from the Tar Company to draw \u00a32.000 sterling on you. We do not doubt that you enter into Swedish obligations carefully enough, but we have been asked to believe that you yourself sometimes stand burdened with \u00a34.000 to \u00a35.000 on account of the Tar Company over and above the value of the effects you have in your hands, which we cannot credit.\n Herewith we return the bills of exchange for \u00a3200 and \u00a3100 accepted by Daniel Planck. The \u00a3100 on Van Racy remains still without acceptance for the reasons we explained in our last. As the time is too short for it to be endorsed he has promised not to plead exception to the endorsement so we shall protest if it is not settled at the due date. \nWith warm regards, &c.",

I do not think it is advisable any more to sell on such long-term credit unless with a rebate or a reduction of the price for cash, because I cannot buy any copper here except for cash and none is sold in Hamburg except for cash and likewise in Holland it is sold for immediate cash-payment, rebating 1 per cent.

We cancelled the commission for Ardasse; this we now confirm. We have since received your letter of the 9th inst., together with the account of the 10 butts of sugar sent with Capt. Willem Oloffsen and now received. We shall look it over and, finding no errors, will record our agreement. We have examined the weight in the casks and we find it turns out reasonably well, but we shall lose Soo lb. by the tare of the butts. The sugar suits us well except that 2 butts turn out to be not so white as the other 8; that is our opinion. If we write to you for white and fine stuff you may get us something similar to the 8 butts in this consignment which have turned out to be white without any brown or rusty stuff amongst it. Please do not hesitate to pay 6d more, but for 1s more it must be extra-choice. Do your best for us. Another friend writes us with this post that great quantities of sugar are expected from Barbados, and the more it declines in price the better you will be able to obtain it. Do your best, because the profits between here and [England] are very meagre. Thus, if you can find an entirely fine batch you may buy us ro or 12 butts and send it here. We shall see if we can remit you a sum at short sight by the next post; if not, you may draw the amount on us and your bills will be duly honoured as has been the \u00a3150 sterling which you drew on us at 2 usances for the sugar, to pay to the order of Marselis van der Hulst. We shall be glad to hear what further happens to this commodity as well as your opinion about pepper. We are glad that you have bought us 24 sacks of Barbados cotton, big and small, at 43d [p. Ib.]. We shall expect the account and your drafts. There is nothing to be done with it here at present and if more comes from [England] it must decline further, for there is no consumption. We hope that you have not bought us any Ardasse for it has fallen greatly here from 19s to 17s within 3 weeks. Therefore, please do not buy us any for we could make no profit with it.\n If you buy Barbados indigo please see to it that it is saleable and of high quality, because weak, blue stuff is not required\u2014for your information. As long as galls are unobtainable in [London] for 46s or 47s it is no use thinking about them for the quantity here is too great and they are very cheap.

    "TEXT": "My last letter to you was about a week ago with which I sent you the bill of lading for 10 barrels of fine blue-dye. Since then I have received yours of the 16th past together with the sale-account concerning the 20 barrels of ordinary, and 8 of fine, blue-dye, which I have examined and found correct. You put down commission at 2 per cent but I hope in future you will be satisfied with 13 per cent, as on purchases, because the profit we make on this is rather meagre.\n I see you are unloading the 3 barrels of arsenicum, though you do not expect to sell it for more than 20s since it is a very poor commodity in [England]. I know perfectly well that a large quantity will not sell. I frequently sell quantities to Englishmen here who send it themselves to [London], paying here for the purchase f.103 or f-11; they must then pay here for an export licence and in [England] for its import, so if they can only sell for 20s they must be very foolish. You must try to get the most you can.\n According to what you write sugar must now be at its lowest, and I would be favourably inclined to buy some, partly in order to dispose of the last lot I got from you\u2014which is still unsold\u2014at a somewhat lower price, and partly in order to mix that with somewhat better quality to make it appear more respectable for sale. But because of the way you served me last time I am very apprehensive, fearing to get bad quality instead of good. If you can do better and obtain extra-good quality at 24s, then buy 30.000 to 40.000 Ib., but get nothing other than the very choicest for as I have already said it is only to serve to improve the appearance of the other lot.! If you cannot get it to your satisfaction you must let it wait as it does not necessarily have to be done today. You can distribute it in 2 or 3 ships and lade them here at the earliest opportunity. I urge you most strongly to procure only the best quality, and see that in weighing it my prescribed weights are observed.\n You indicated ginger to be at 48s. If you can obtain good quality at that price, free on board, please buy 8.000 to 10.000 lb. and send it here also. Cubeb, I understand, are selling at \u00a36 tos in [London]. If they can still be had for that you may also undertake the purchase of 1.000 or 1.200 Ib. Six ships have returned safely to this country from the Indies, namely four from Ceylon (of whose cargoes you have heard already) and two from Batavia of which the cargo is not yet known.

Ihave seen what you write about timber and I shall be happy to participate in whatever may develop. I would be glad to learn if something could be done to procure passes, for we have rather a lot of timber lying on Gotland which cannot be got to [England] for lack of shipping space but which otherwise could come this year if one could get passes. The price at which you have sold the iron from the Fortuna I have noted, as well as the price at which you say the English are selling the iron which has come this year. They will get little profit by it as I believe it will begin to cost more here. It is lamentable that such an imperishable commodity should be undersold, and if they continue to conduct themselves in this way in [England] while large amounts are still coming things will go badly this year, for I see that much has been shipped from here, but I trust that it comes into firm hands and remains there at a good price.\n You will have learned from my previous letter what I have sent to you, and I hope the ship is now well out to sca\u2014God bring him soon in safety. I have also noted the price of copperwire, copper-sheets and rods, and it will serve for my guidance. Swedish-built ships to carry timberware from Gotland are not to be had here, and are also too expensive to charter. I shall expect the account of the iron from the Fortuna at the earliest opportunity. Iam sorry to hear from Amsterdam that Peter Simons\u2019 affairs turn out quite differently from what he told me here. He wrote to me on the 25th past and has begged me to beg you to sign the agreement with him as he will always try to satisfy you. I ask you to oblige him as far as you can, not doubting that he will be grateful.\n I have consigned to you in the following ships iron as follows: \n779 bars\u2014Slb. 103.11 flat, ordinary \u2018Crown\u2019 iron with Capt. Claes Holtz of the 866 bars\u2014Slb. 118.10 } ship De Gecroonde Parel according to the enclosed bill of lading; and also,999 bars\u2014Slb. 152.14 flat iron, with Capt. Jacob Grys of the St Anna, of\nwhich the bill of lading will be sent by my next. I have ordered the Messrs Van Baerle to see to the insurance. I hope to send you the bill of lading of another cargo by my next. Please make the proceeds over to the Messrs Van Baerle. Herewith farewell, &c.",

We would have loaded more iron in the St Anna but because of contrary winds it has not arrived. By our next letter we will advise what other batches you can expect from here and from Gothenburg.\n Concerning the delivery of copper of which you were thinking, we are not much inclined to it and cannot make up our minds as copper is very dear here and at the price you mentioned it would render a poor account. It is rising daily so that one can make no firm estimate. We can probably do better by selling our wares here. We were very surprised to learn of the serious situation of Mr Simons\u2019 affairs in Amsterdam. He had informed us otherwise when he was here, and we have learned nothing else from him than that he had reached agreement with Mr Abraham Momma about how you were to be reimbursed. We now hear the contrary. Since he had so many claims on the Tar Company here he should have been able to obtain the necessary means, and we are heartily sorry that you are so deeply involved. God knows, we would have watched out better for you if we had known. You can expect a good quantity of iron from Gothenburg, although it is taking so long that one gets weary. Cordial regards, &c. \n[P.S.] Please give the enclosed open letter to captain Nils Anderson, skipper of the ship De Witte Duyve, freighted to you by the [Tar] Company and demand of him the freight money he has earned and hold it until further disposition, and whatever the captain may need for the ship\u2019s requirements you can let him have back.",

As a result, I cannot afford to take less, and that for cash down or within 1 month of delivery, and you should please be prepared to allow me to draw on you at double usance for at least three-quarters of the value of the cargo as soon as the bill of lading has been sent.

Your letters of 25th past and 2nd inst. have now come to hand, in which we see that you have given up the two warchouses at Deptford and two others at Blackwall, debiting us with \u00a324 for their rent, and have leased two others at Blackwall for 3 years at \u00a350 per annum, of which we have made a note. It isa good thing that you have only hired two for the moment. Whenever one needs more one can easily find the opportunity. With the Company ships being unfree exports are going rather poorly, for the little schuits can take in so little. We sent you a note a week ago about how much had so far been sent to all places, but a mistake was Padeabene captain Thomas Klerck where he is noted as having 60 lasts of tar and 20 lasts of pitch whereas according to the accompanying bill of lading he had taken in 27 2 lasts of tar and 15 lasts of pitch. Since then we have chartered two others for [England], that is\u2014captain Erick Anderson Brandt, of the schuit Fortuna, and captain [blank]. The former will have his cargo aboard within three days and the other, God willing, will be cleared within eight days, so we hope to send the bills of lading by our next letter.

My brother had the honour of saluting you in [London] about one-and-a-half years ago with my cousin, Dominicus Juncker, and to inquire if we could establish a regular correspondence between us. I have been greatly inclined to get a good quantity of Barbados sugar, but only of the finest and best quality of the sort you provided for my nephew Paul Berenberg. In procuring the purchase make sure it is at a reasonable price and in the right condition\u2014especially ifit reaches 22s or, at most, 23s. Also Barbados cotton at 4-pence and good Aleppo gall-nuts at 45-46s, as a friend of mine says he has had, which are likely to be 46s. Please also tell me how much nice, dry English leather is fetching. Here it is at a very low price and I am sure it can only be at 6d in [England].\n For some time I have been selling a good deal of linen alamodes to the English here, which is apparently sent to Barbados and the colonies. Please find out in [London] how much a piece of 7o ells, 2 broad, would fetch, a sample of which is here enclosed and which I can have made in all kinds of fashions. If you also had the opportunity to dispose of about 100 barrels of tin, of the mark of the Horse, which is the best sort, I could provide it. If you cannot reach agreement in [London] you could take the tin barrels, which are RD 21 (I say, one and twenty) free on board, and set against them a delivery of sugars and Barbados cotton (which must be entirely good) and I shall set against it as much money as the tin is worth and you could take the commission on both the tin and the sugars. I have arranged to do so with a friend here and it has worked out well. I would at once send you the 100 barrels of tin and remit you RD 2.000 which would at least provide for the above-said sugars. \n[P.S.] You must expect, since most of my business is with Germany, that I must try to dispose of commodities coming from there, and on this basis we could co-operate and do important business together every year. I await your answer and remain, with friendly regards, &c. [P.P.S.] If pepper should come down to 8-84d in [London], free on board, then buy me 20 sacks and send them here with the first ship.

    "TEXT": "The foregoing, dated the 21st past, is a copy of my last letter, to which I refer you. I have since received yours of the 25th and 29th of June, and 9th and 3oth of July, the contents of which are fully understood and to which the answer shortly follows herewith. Ihave received the account of the iron sold from the Fortuyn and found it correct. I have debited you with the proceeds, \u00a3325 11s 6d and credited you with the RD 140 from my lord Pistolhielm at 45 od each, being \u00a333 ss. The idea that I should be paid here at the rate of 5s 6d is a mistake, for they can be got for no more than 533. [d.c.m.] Ihave seen what you write about the price of iron and other things, and it is annoying that some dealers should undersell by offering it at \u00a314 per ton on delivery. They achieve nothing but loss by doing so as they have bought it dearly here. I hope it remains at a good price so that one will continue to want to send it. I expect to hear in due course. With regard to what you write about charges on the iron I send to you, you are to understand it as we have done formerly, namely that for whatever expenditure you incur you can take interest, and if any losses should occur\u2014which God forbid! it is well-insured and you will recover your outlay from those gentlemen who have drawn on you for my account, so you run no risk and there is no need for you to make difficulties. It seems to me rather strange, what you say you have written to Messrs Van Baerlc, that they should not draw on you before the ship has reached [London]. If they are to fulfil my drafts on them they must be able to draw RD 2.500 on you. My request is that you will allow them to draw as much on youas the proceeds approximately come to, though deducting what you may have advanced for me already according to the accompanying account. And as regards what has happened, I have looked into it and find that when the 158 barrels of steel were estimated to be worth \u00a3160! you were already about \u00a3340 out of pocket. Please let Messrs Van Baerle have any proceeds arising in excess of that amount. I depend on that as I have charged them with my drafts and will draw accordingly on future deliveries.\n Hereinclosed I send 3 bills of lading of iron laden for my account in the ship Mars, captain Hans Johanson, together amounting to Slb. 872.10, including various sorts of \u2018English-style\u20192 bar-iron and Slb. 117.15.10 of forged band-iron. NB that in future it must be sold at higher prices, as I have written to you before and to which I refer you. Herewith also is a bill of lading from Capt. Hendrick Claessen Boender for Slb. 305.15.10 of \u2018English-style\u2019 bar iron, all of which I am consigning to you, and I have another batch which will follow. In selling it] urge you to have as much regard for my profit as if it were your own: I depend upon it. Ihave read what you tell me about Peter Simons and am surprised that you did not write to meat once about what you let him draw on you. I never thought his affairs would turn out so badly, and as for me being indebted to him for f.8.00o\u2014I can prove the contrary as he owes me for Portuguese drafts, so I do not know how I can help you. I do not doubt that he will try to satisfy you in full, as he has written to me, only you must enter into the agreement with him. God protect each and all from misfortune, &c.",

I had hoped that the undercutters would not have moved in so suddenly.! It is much to be wished that this trade could be brought into a few hands and by that means preserve its reputation. You will know how to seek the most advantage for my consignments, which remain commended to your care.\n As the prospect of bringing some timber to [England] in foreign-built ships and getting passes for them has faded for the moment, we must let it pass until a better opportunity arises. [have still about 800 to 1.000 shippounds of iron standing ready which I intend to send in the ship Jupiter unless some other shipping turns up so that I can divide the consignment, but I very much hope that it will obtain a better price. At the present price I think it advisable to be careful with my consignment and wait for some improvement. Then, I beg you, let the Messrs Van Baerle have what they need for my account. Iam of the opinion that iron will not remain at such a low price, and would also be glad to know your views. Herewith goes the bill of lading of Hendrick Claessen Boender which I forgot to insert in the foregoing.\n Let the Messrs Van Baerle have as much as the iron proceeds amount to, and I will make good the interest on what you advance.

I wish you had sent to me in April or May\u2014I would have been able to do something but it is too late now and I must hope that he, Simons, will take good care to satisfy you.

We have been paid the \u00a3100 stg. at 355 11g drawn on John Lodge, and have credited your account.\n We are sorry to see that you are in dispute with the Vastervik Ship Company. Our friend at Rotterdam wrote us on the rith instant that he has sold another four 6-pounder cannon at [f]8: 151 on the same terms as the last, and as the guns are old and inferior we consider he has done well. However, we have since then written to him to hold back from selling fora while, We have taken expert advice about the sample of cotton but find that it is too coarse for East Indian yarn and most resembles yarn from the Straits, of which there is at present a reasonable amount in town. The yarn sold by our East India Company is fine, like the accompanying sample, and sells at 28 to 27 s[tuivers] per Ib. That which was sold at 163st was badly made up and as a result it fetched less than others just as fine. But we judge that cotton yarn which is no coarser than your sample should sell for 16 st per Ib., and you will please note that the finest are the most sought after. Such yarn is mostly used at Haarlem for textiles and other stuffs,? and because little has arrived here this year from the East Indies we believe it would not do badly if you could find something finer\u2014or certainly not coarser-\u2014than the sample you sent.\n We see that the price of copper-wire has risen somewhat and is likely to continue to do so as little has been sent to London. We have noted how much of J. R[censtierna]\u2019s wire has been sold, and we hope you will soon be able to close the account of W.M[omma]\u2019s copper-wire. We have procured the necessary acceptance of the \u00a3935 12s 2d stg which you remitted to us in ten bills of exchange for my Lord Jacob Reenstierna\u2019s account and he has been informed of it.\n You wrote to us about remittances being made against A.

Your next letters will possibly inform us further. Peter Simons is lying sick in bed. As his settlement has not yet been signed by as many creditors as are required for it to take effect we suggest that you demand his guarantee in case the remaining creditors refuse to sign and he is released from his obligations. What happens next only time will tell.\n As you ordered us not to hurry with remittances we shall return your accepted bills of exchange of \u00a3100 on Jean de Roy and \u00a3200 on Roelandt Cockey with our next\u2014 wherewith our heartiest regards, &c.",

    "TEXT": "Sir, For answer to yours of the 16th courant I say that Mr Muns has not since my last byn with me to adjust his bisnes, but I purpos to preserve your interest in the lead as my one and shal doe with him when he comes the best I can. And as to the bisnes of the ship St Gorge from Colmer, if she comes heare I shal arrest her and the master and purser as you order. As to the proposition I made you consirning pitch and tar and iron, I say that as to the quantity I say 150 last tar and 20 or 30 last pitch wil be enof, and 60 tun iron, the first ship to be heare in May and the last in September, and as to the price I leave that to you to propos. I conseave its proper for you to make your demands. You may essely see the charge by the accounts I sent you and thereby mack an estimate. Now if you plese to consider that I profit to become your debptor for the hole that you send and that you wil for future run noe risks but be ponctially complied with at the tyme we agree for I thinck it wil be to your intrest to be at asurtainty, If therefore you plese to consider the hole and to pitch me aprice resonnabel both that it may be worth my trobel and paynes and cost, you shal soune have my answer. This is al at present. I rest, Sir, your assured frind and servant. \n[P.S.] The reson that I mack you this proposition to be at a sertainty is because that I have often occation myself to fil up my ships that goe to the southward with thos goods for ballast and being in my own hands I can then dispos of it as I please. It is not for the great profit it turnes to but for the acomodation of my conveniency, and if I did not vent great part of it my self it is not the 5 the quantity could be disposed of here by any man but my self. I leave it to your consideration and rest.",

    "TEXT": "Our last letter was about a week ago, to which we refer you. Since then we have received yours of the 27th past and 3rd instant, by which we are delighted to hear of the arrival of Thomas Klerck. We hope the Lord will have brought the others in safety. By our last you should have had the bill of lading of Capt. Erick Fix, his cargo being 327 lasts of tar and 18 lasts of pitch. We have given orders for the insurance thereon, as well as on Hans Johanson and Anders Krock, and wait to learn the result. Please also take care of the insurance, according to contract, of Jacob Pieters Potteut\u2019s cargo, being 74 small lasts of tar and 39 lasts of pitch. Capt. Olof Erickson\u2019s ship will be ready for loading soon, and Nathaniel Fabrius\u2019s ship is expected from Calmar every hour. We have also chartered the ship Jupiter, Capt. Jacob Fix, which will be coming in for loading next week. Hans Reyser\u2019s ship was built in an unfree place so we have not dared to load it.\n Meanwhile, Mr Jacob Sempel has procured a recommendation from his Excellency the English Ambassador for the free export of 150 lasts of pitch, since he has paid the Company for permission, and the goods are all consigned to you. We have loaded 85 lasts of pitch for that voyage, for your information.\n We have examined the four sale-accounts of tar and pitch and found them correct and debited you for the proceeds. We shall try our best to send 70 lasts of tar and 10 lasts of pitch to Yarmouth and 4o lasts of tar and 15 lasts of pitch to the Isle of Wight, but we see no chance of doing so as there are few native-built ships here and they have all been freighted for {England] by others; and as long as there is a shortage of goods in London we think it inadvisable to send them to the small places.\n We note that you have been approached by two friends who want to buy 600 lasts of tar and 200 lasts of pitch to be delivered to them between now and March next, for which they have offered \u00a384 and \u00a3114 respectively, payable in 6 months, with nothing for warchouse rent\u2014to which you await our answer. We will tell you, then, that we would sooner have the highest possible price as the warehouses are already hired, and we also hope that the goods will be in demand in the spring if all the necessary ships can be obtained. But if your friends want to be reasonable and pay the money on delivery we would not quibble about ten shillings.\n We see you were obliged to pay \u00a3152 concerning the verdict in the water-balliage case, and you say you would be glad to know if you should spend something more to prevent the case coming to a halt. If you believe it would help and see that something can be gained thereby we shall be glad to spend something more, but we could not agree to making our expenses still bigger and then lose the whole sum. For the rest we leave it to you to do as you judge best and as you find matters stand.\n Concerning the case of Mr Peter Simons, we can truly say that nothing would please us more than to assist you but there is not a penny to be got from him here, and we swear on our conscience that we are owed three times as much as you are, of which we see no chance of getting a stuiver. He has given us his guarantee, but that is not money, and we do not see how that can help us, or you, in this business. We must break off here and commend you to God\u2019s protection, &c.",

With regard to the price it is, as you say, far too low now that there is no wire in any other hands, and I shall have little inclination to send more to [England]. There is none to be had from Holland; at Hamburg they give 62 ML cash-down, with the prospect of going higher, so there will be little desire to send it from here. The wire you have just sold you have had in your hands since it was shipped from here in March 1668, and to sell it now for 6 months time means that one has been waiting for one\u2019s money for more than two years, which is something this commodity cannot support. You must improve on this long delay. Wherewith my heartiest regards, &c.",

I have since received simultancously both your letters of the 1oth and 17th past, to which the answer follows forthwith.\n Concerning the \u00a3200 advance on bottomry for the Calmar ship, I understood that this had been drawn on and that Mr Pels had disbursed the money while you have not paid out the \u00a3200 to Messrs Burkin & Evertsen, so please hold it back until the next post. I shall firstly correspond with Mr Anthony Bruyn the elder about it and then give you further advice. The kettle-designs\u2019 have reached Gotland, from whence I am now awaiting them. I hope at last you will get it right for once.\n As for your friend who is asking for a consignment of copper, I cannot accommodate him this autumn as I have already told you, and since he is in such a hurry for a delivery I must allow him to be supplied by others. I cannot yet be sure whether I can send anything to [England] this year, but as for next year\u2014God willing\u2014if you agree with my previous proposal, to supply me with money this winter at 6 per cent interest, you could count on receiving a substantial quantity in the spring and I would be able to make a big saving by keeping these large works with all their people in full employment all through the winter-\u2014 to which I await your decision.\n I again commend to you the sale of my goods, especially the thick copper rods. Please sell them for the best you can get\u2014they are good for making small bars from and are quite as good as garcopper.\n Ihave now examined your current account and credited you with \u00a32.316 16s uponanew account dated 6 August\u2014that is to say, for two thousand three hundred and sixteen pounds sterling and 16s.\n While brass-ware is now coming solely into your hands I hope you will drive the price up rather higher than it has been so far, particularly as garcopper is steadily getting more expensive.

In reply, we have sold the remaining small lead received with the St Justina at D.50 with 3 months time to Vincenzo Fieri. Accompanying this is the account of the proceeds, your one-third share amounting to D.906 5g bank-money. Please credit us, without prejudice, as if the money had come in, and if you check over the account and find it correct please make a note of your concurrence. We are doing everything possible to dispose of the remaining 250 pieces of small lead from the Thomas and Francis, and although there are no buyers now at D.49 with 3 months credit we shall let no good opportunity pass. As you will sce at the foot of this letter} we have also sold the remaining 6 bales of pepper from the same ship, together with 21 from the Pearl which, God be praised! arrived here this week with the Frederick. They took in a passenger at Zante who had been taken there from Candia, and as result they have been unable to obtain practica.\u2019 All the cargo has been sent to the Lazaretto and the pepper as well must be re-packed in other sacks. This will cause further expense, but as there is no other remedy we must be patient. If good purchasers make offers for the remaining 4 sacks we shall take good care of it. We have been made offers for the first to arrive, which we believe will fetch a reasonable price. We understand it ought to be selling in [England] somewhat cheaper but we fear the quantity will pull the price down and we hope that that which your brother{-in-law] John LeTheullier and his friends intend to send will be the first to come to market.\n The best Stockholm tar in thin casks was lately sold here at D.42 per 1.000 Ib. with 30 per cent tare for the casks. There is not so much demand from buyers for it in thick casks and it sells at D.4 per 1.000 Ib. less with 33 per cent tare\u2014all gross weight. Any ship which comes fully laden with these goods, among others, enjoys freedom from the new impost on currants loaded at Zante.\n Some salted Irish salmon came with the Pearl for which no price has been established but we imagine it will fetch about D.28 to D.30 per barrel. Barbados sugar is at D.6 per hundredweight with 12 months discount. Spanish muscovadoes are at D.8 with 6 months discount. Gallipoly oil is D.15\u00a7 free on board, and Zante currants have been bought at about R. pta. 29. Be assured that anything further you may be pleased to order will be dealt with as if your, and your friends\u2019, interests were as close to our hearts as our own. We remit you herewith another D.1.200 as indicated at the foot of this letter.\u00a7 Please do the necessary and credit us accordingly. Herewith goes the second copy of the bill of exchange for D.100 remitted you by our previous letter.\nt 1 bale to Rocco Sansonio; 1 to Iseppo Sansonio; 4 to Iseppo Tasso, all at D.75 with 2 months credit. 4 to Gio. Gueringo; 3 to Antonio Michielli at D.75 with 3 months credit, 4 to Gio, Maria Laghi at D.78 with 3 months credit. 10 to Pietro Gerrardi at D.77 with 2 months credit. \u00a7 D.1.200 at 544d sterling [per ducat] in a bill of Gio, Druveysteyn on Gio. Davis. We have sold the 100 pieces of lead from the Pearl at D.s0 with 4 months discount to Bortolo Massalini and it is now being unloaded and delivered to the buyer. This saves the expense of bringing it in. At the moment we see no prospect of improvement to judge by the demand of buyers so far.",

I perceive it has made great changes in [London] but it is given little credence here and there is absolutely no change, with reasonable goods still selling at 6; to 6g @ 13 months discount. I do not believe it will cause any price rise for the moment as there are good stocks here and our sugar bakers are well provided so that there will be no lack of it for six months. Consequently there will be no commissions sent to [England] for a while and the price of sugar in [London] may well fall, particularly as it is believed that the damage in Barbados was not very great. In addition, it is believed that satisfactory amounts will be obtainable in the spring and, besides that, the present freightrates and the dangers of the sea give one good reason for leaving it alone now.

As regards its sale, please do your best, and if not much is to be got for it I shall have to be satisfied for it was sold for cash. May our dear Lord grant us only good news of it! As for what you say concerning Mr Maricie? having told you that he is in negotiation with me about cloth\u2014I can tell you that I have not been much away from home for seven years, but my father-in-law has frequently contracted with him for large quantities and I have often sent the same people large amounts of iron from Sweden. We have been dealing with one another for 24 years, but we do not do so anymore and find it is best to take only ready cash. And when one has had no money to buy goods of which one has had need this man has treated us very well but since he has been in the cloth court? our trade with one another has come to an end. Since then we have yearly bought large amounts of crown rashes and other sorts of English manufactures. Now we have our goods brought from [England] and every year we make two voyages\u2014one early in spring and the other just before winter. So, please inform me if you have any knowledge of cloth and other manufactures and whether or not you are involved in the Court and whether you can supply me at first hand in return for a yearly commission? If so, we can under God do big business with one another and in return you will be promptly sent other goods such as that in the accompanying bill of lading for a case of linen of the kind which I have sold great amounts of every year to Mr Moricie\u2019s factor here. If you can dispose of it a large amount could be sent, and in the accompanying invoice we have stated the price which Mr Moricie\u2019s factor always paid us so you can see whether it is reasonable to continue with selling the same.\n Please also advise us if steel bars are a good commodity and at what price per ton or per pound they are selling. May God bring the case of linen in safety, with our regards, &c. \n[P.S.] Before now I have been sending to [England] iron-bound chests which come from Niirnberg. I do not know if it is convenient for you to deal in them; if not, could you please recommend them to someone who buys such [chests] and let me know what price they fetch. T await your advice on all this and also, if one buys cloth, crown rashes, serges, at what rate they pay duty and whether or not they are burdened with heavy taxes. I understand that if one is a member of the Court one has a great advantage in the duty. If you cannot send the goods here they could well be unloaded at Gliickstadt or Stade, as long as they only pay a moderate toll,",

    "TEXT": "Our last letter was a week ago, to which we refer you. We have now received together yours of the roth and 17th past. We looked over the sale account and reported our findings to you in our foregoing letter. We have now received the current account and will have it examined next weck before telling you our findings.\n We will be mindful of sending the requested 10 lasts of pitch and 70 of tar to Yarmouth as well as the 15 lasts of pitch and 40 of tar to the Isle of Wight if only we can find suitable shipping. We shall use our utmost endeavours. The 4 ships mentioned in our last letter are now all lying together being loaded and by our next we hope to send you all their bills of lading. We are at the moment in negotiation with another to go to [England]: with what success we will tell you later.\n The Lord God be praised for the arrival of Matthys Boriesen and Erick Anderson\u2014may He bring the others in safety! It is good that you have been able to sell all the cargoes of the above mentioned and we hope the rest will be similarly disposed of. Concerning the proposition of your two friends about buying 600 lasts of tar and 200 lasts of pitch, we refer you to our previous letter and would prefer to look for the highest possible price, though if your friends would move little further and go up to \u00a39 and \u00a312 we would agree to it. The offer of \u00a383 and \u00a3114 is too little. [We are doing our best to bring it to the highest price.]*\n Concerning the case of the water balliage on which you seck our approval for spending more. We urge you to do as you would for yourself, and if you see something to be gained by it we shall gladly spend more, but if it is a matter of spending yet more on an uncertainty and then losing the case we would rather lose now than later, so we suggest that you do as you would for yourself. The directors of the Vastervik Ship Company have probably forgotten to advise you about placing \u00a3177 15s 2d expenses on their account, but they entered in to it voluntarily and in fairness they must do so because it is their case as much as ours. We shall speak to them about it so that you can get instructions from them. By our previous letter we asked you about giving Mr Deutz another \u00a32.000 stg. on top of the first \u00a32.000 because we would be sending you as much or more in goods, and now you say you have written to Mr Deutz that he could draw \u00a3200-\u00a3300\u2014by which you doubtless mean \u2018thousands\u2019. If that is the case, and if you will remit to hin as we requested, we most cordially thank you. He will not have done so yet, but we are very pleased that you have written to him and that you will duly honour his bills when he draws on you, though most of the drafts we have made on him fall due in January and February. We hope you have taken care of the insurance on all those ships as we ordered.\n As we have said to you before, though with much regret, there is nothing here to be hoped for from Peter Simons. It is very annoying that one must suffer loss for one\u2019s good will, but what can one do? We too think it is hard. We remain, &c.",

    "TEXT": "We find ourselves with your welcome letter of the 22nd past. In reply, we await your convenience to know if, having received the accounts of the gor pieces of small lead and the 100 pieces of great lead sold at Genoa, you have found them satisfactory. We send you herewith the account of the 250 pieces received from the Thomas & Francis, of which half the proceeds amounts to D.528 16g bank-money. Please credit us accordingly, without prejudice, while the money comes in, and after you have checked the account and found it correct please record your agreement. That commodity remains here still at D.48 because there is plenty in town and the buyers are for the moment well-provided since\u2014God be praised\u2014the John & Thomas arrived here yesterday bringing another good quantity. But as the price remains stable in England and apparently little more will be sent we hope it may improve in price, particularly in the spring.\n The 462 bars as well as the 17 casks of tin are being offered at the highest price possible, but we regret that the 9 casks which we received earlier must be kept in the warehouse as the quantity does not suit the buyers. We hope the batch in the casks will do better and find a quicker sale. We will let you know how we fare in our next.\n We see that you have loaded in the Providence, for your account, 50 bales of pepper and 75 pieces of great lead, and that Mr Lethicullier and other friends will load yet more, amounting to 300 bales of pepper and 450 pieces of lead. We thank you for your kindness in recommending us to others and we shall not fail to do our duty, seeking at all times to sell quickly and at the highest price possible and making speedy returns to your friends. We hope to hear by your next that the ship has departed. May the Lord protect him from mishap and give him a speedy arrival so that the pepper gets here before the candle-days.! Otherwise, the season will be over. Many say that whoever arrives here before the others can expect to profit, for undoubtedly the first to arrive will get the best prices. We understand that The Brothers has also been consigned here with a large amount, and was lying in the Downs on the point of departure, but as he must go and load the rest of his cargo with furs we hope the Providence will get here before him. We sce that your friends then plan to procure returns in oil. The latter is selling at D.154 per salm, free on board, at Gallipoly where it is better value than elsewhere in Apuglia and where most of it is loaded for [England] and other regions. At Bari it is fetching D.15} free on board, the measure there being about 6 per cent larger than at Gallipoly but the oil is of worse quality. One can get reasonably good oil at Taranto but we understand there are no good barrels to be obtained there and the price of the oil is about the same as at Gallipoly, so in our opinion it would be best to be provided there. The new oil should be clear by the end of January. It was ordered here that a quarter of last year\u2019s oil should not be put on sale and the remainder kept at a high price, but nevertheless it is the opinion of our friends that it may initially fall rather lower as long as no large commissions are obtained. I believe the said ships will be able to lade the new oil and think it might not be inadvisable to lade 20 lasts of heavy oil as ballast, as was tried last with the Gratia, The oil was well-stowed and arrived with little leakage, and since the last of oil is small we should be able to count on loading at least 700 salm or more, at 10 salms per last, as it isa ship of 160 tons. You and your friends can best decide what you judge to be advisable and order us to act accordingly.\n There have been no further letters from Zante. The general opinion is that currants there will cost more than R. pra. 32; on Cephalonia they are paying R. pta. 26 and 27. The John & Thomas is also going there to fetch its lading and will need a pretty large amount. Barbados muscovado sugar\u2014D.6 with 12 months time; ditto from Lisbon\u2014D.6 with 6 months. Pepper, since there is little or none left in town, sells at the second hand for D.84. Veronese rice D.18, with freight for Amsterdam f.65 per last. No change in other commodities.\n We remit you herewith D400 as detailed at the foot of this letter, for which please procure the needful and credit us accordingly. Wherewith our cordial regards, &c. \nLondon\u2014s4id. Amsterdam\u2014g5?. [P.S.] D.400 at 54d sterling drawn on Henry Mudd by Hailes & Ravenscroft.

The reason is that you do not manage the expenses very well and tend to make them rather too large. How much truth there is in that you can best judge for yourself but I can only give you this friendly advice to serve as far as possible as a warning of what to expect, for without it you could easily lose their commissions, especially the principal commission for copper-ware and rods as well as of iron. I have delayed any such change, and but for that it would have happened. Wherewith, regards, &c.",

Jacob Gries for which he has signed a bottomry bill and you request our approval\u2014to which we answer that the bottomry bill is valueless as our colleagues will not approve it. He shall repay the \u00a3100 here and it will then be remitted to you. The captain did it without instructions and had no reason to imagine that he needed the money as our colleagues had taken care that he could get credit at Lisbon if he found himself short for his salt cargo.\n We see you have sold 238 bars of iron from Gothenburg at 135 6d p. cwt. That is good and we urge you to keep our interests at heart with the remainder as the consignments sold this summer have turned to poor account.\n The Messrs Louis de la Bistrate & Jacob Frederick Dufay at Amsterdam advise us that they have drawn \u00a3330 sterling on you, not doubting that you will have honoured these drafts as you have previous orders and noted them on our account.\n Trade has finished here for the year and the sea and all rivers can only be traversed with horse and sledge, and there is a great shortage of water at the works so there will not be much iron ready for the spring. We suggest therefore that you hold on to our remaining iron, for the market must rise.\n As for the \u00a3100 which you gave to the captain of the St Anna on the credit of his salt cargo we shall, as we said above, make you a remittance as soon as it arrives. The captain had no need to trouble you. The price at which the iron has been sold in Bristol is disgraceful\u2014it would have been better to sell it here. As for the samples of materials! you sent, they are not in demand here\u2014we can get them cheaper in Holland, wherewith our cordial regards, &c.",

    "TEXT": "Our last letter was about a week ago, to which we refer, and since then we have received nothing from you. In our foregoing letter we said of Capt. Jan Pietersen that he had run into Boswyck in order to repair his ship, but the leak was nothing serious and was soon mended and he has since gone to sea again, so we hope to hear of his arrival soon. Meanwhile, a week ago, we made a note of the insurance you made upon him and have credited your account with \u00a322 6s 7d for the premium and expenses. We long to hear that you have also taken care of the insurance on the ships following, and with regard to that we refer you to our preceding letter.\n Concerning the advance of money on our goods according to contract, we send herein a detailed account\" specifying how much they amount to. As we have repeatedly told you, we have to make good that total to Mr Joseph Deutz on whom we have drawn RD 30.000, but Mr Deutz says that he has not yet had full agreement from you as to the sum which you will accept, and that you will only accept as much as the goods in your hands amount to. But that was not the intention of the contract which clearly states, in the words of the sth article, that whenever the Company sends the bill of lading for any pitch or tar and gives orders for it to be insured, then the Company may draw or have drawn on you for each last of tar \u00a35 and for each last of pitch \u00a38, which you promised to accept and pay. So we again request you to make good and pay Deutz the sums specified in the above-mentioned statement when he draws on you, because the time is approaching when our bills on him fall due. We shall let Deutz know that he can proceed with assurance, for we would lose his respect if we gave any orders contrary to the terms of our contract. Our credit would plunge steeply and you can be sure that he would not be so ready to take our bills in future. Therefore we must show him that he can get his reimbursement from you, or anyone else. We await your reply with quiet confidence, breaking off here with our best wishes, &c.",

I beg you asa friend not to sell at such long time if possible, and I do not doubt that it will suit you to do so seeing that you are content to do without double commission. Besides, it will breed more business. I long to know what is happening and I wish with all my heart to hear from you regarding the linen and to know what we can do with it. If the price yields something I shall send you 1.000 pieces or more every year, as long as consumption is that large, and I shall not seek any exceptional profit as long as I can cover my costs, because between here and Niirnberg we are making a loss. My brother-in-law is on the point of departure for places like Linz where the linen comes from and where he will obtain another consignment. We wait to hear what you think about sending another batch as soon as the rivers unfreeze. As regards the wool, it still remains unsold but we have had offers from an Englishman here who will make a deal for it, half in cash and half in goods. As wool remains at 15 per lb. Iam not sure what to do. If, at your convenience, you could inform me at what prices silk stockings and all kinds of men\u2019s and women\u2019s stockings are selling I shall see if I shall have some bought. Some days ago Joris Schrodering, a member of one of our great houses,\u2019 went out of business and two days ago killed himself in depression, causing the failure of George Mattzen as a result of many great suspicions. He had served many important merchants on commission, but I am involved only to the extent of t barrel of Niirnberg-ware, a remnant of eight years\u2019 dealings. Things are very bad here.\n You were perhaps corresponding with the Swedish Treasurer, Borgh Oloffson Cronenberg, in Stockholm? He has been dismissed and so have Generals Wilhelm Drakenhielm and Starrenflicht. Hinrich Thuen is now the Royal Treasurer and people are now making great efforts to find ways of serving him.*\n Since times are so bad here I shall make use of your offer of help and may well draw \u00a3125 or \u00a3150 on you in my next letter, as long as you will advance the money at 3 per cent per month until my goods are sold to that amount.

I hope to see the account soon.\n I have also noted what has been happening with that person concerning the 60 tons to be delivered at Stockholm, free on board, The proposal will certainly not suit me. I would not want to deliver it to an English ship for only \u00a312 because the customs liability on each shippound would amount to about a quarter of that, quite apart from the Sound Toll which will be at least 150 RD. And as for going to France to fetch salt and bringing it to Stockholm, that will not do because there is no demand for French salt in Sweden and there would be no return from the investment, It is better to drop the whole idea until May when the amount of iron coming in will increase, No ships can leave Sweden before then because I doubt that there have been more than four days of thaw so far.\n If your friend tries to go looking for a cargo for his ship in the manner you describe his ship would be at least half-pawned? before it came home again. I would not advise him to go to Sweden with an English ship: the difference in duties is too great. The bill of lading for the remaining pan iron which we have here was sent to you by the last letter. The captain is quite ready to go but the low water prevents him from leaving, with which I remain, &c.",

I shall only decide to do it if I receive the account and can reckon on some profit. I must say that to sell at 6 months time is too long, and for the money to be discounted without prejudice to you is really too much of a risk. As soon as the money comes in I shall expect its remittance.\n Ihave sent you 400 bars of square iron in Jacob Hendrixsen\u2019s ship De Schol. As Liege iron, one-inch thick, this iron must be sold for at least 15s 6d [p. cwt] or else it cannot be sent. I hope it will go higher. I am paid here \u00a372 [Aem.] per 100 Ib. in cash for the kind I send to England. Asa sample I have sent with the captain 25 bars of light, flat-iron weighing (in our weight) 600 Ib. It is marked with an \u2018S\u2019 and is extraordinarily fine, tough iron as you will be able to see, and it is the sort of iron from which pistols and muskets are made. Find out what price per hundred-pounds you can sell it for and if I consider there is some profit to be made I shall send you a quantity. The square iron is marked \u201cB\u2019 and is of much better material than the flat-iron I have sent. God protect you, &c.\n[P.S.] Ihave just received your letter of the 28th and must say that if you had sent the account I would have been able to make an estimate. The iron I sent you which you have sold is carefully forged and is purer than Swedish. And as for what you say about somewhat thinner iron, I cannot deliver you any although I could pick out some of the longer bars from the kind marked with the Lute, but then you would only get 32 or 33 bars instead of 34 in every 1.000 Ib.

Regarding the purchase of a quantity of indigo, I have been unable to make up my mind since that commodity is in declining demand, and I also understand that great deceits have been found inside the sealed boxes which have come from [England] and some batches have been found to be extremely oily. Sugar also will do no wonders here notwithstanding the fact that there is little obtainable in [England]. Large amounts are coming from Portugal and just now \u00a7 ships, mostly laden with it, have arrived from Oporto. The ships which are expected daily from Spain will also not fail to provide good quantities of indigo, so I can see no advantage in bringing these two commodities from [England] unless they should come to very moderate prices on the arrival of the Caribbean ships. If there should be some change, especially in sugar, I shall be glad to participate. Ginger has been in some demand here but since substantial amounts have arrived in [England] and more are expected it should soon fall in price. Cottons will do no wonders here for the moment, though little may come this year; pepper seems not yet to be at its lowest level, and galls\u2014as I have said before\u2014will not rise for the present. I would be glad to know how much semencina\u2019 or semensaet costs in [England] and whether there is much in stock, and I look forward to more fruitful opportunities arising from our correspondence. I remain, with cordial regards, &c.\n [P.S.] I shall be glad to kno wif the ships from Barbados must serve quarantine in [England].",

In reply, you will have learned from my last letter that I certainly do not find it advisable to participate in the contract for making farthings. How the contractors will fare, time will tell. I can also foresee no profit in sending copper-plate or sheet copper, especially since the duties have been raised. I wish you would send me an exact list of the duties on all imported Swedish wares for my guidance. As for the rest of my wire, I hope you will soon dispose of it so that I can close the account. As for the wire I had at Stockholm, since I could not load it in the ship freighted by Cronstr\u00e9m and as no other opportunity arose, I let it go to Hamburg.\n The inland waters are just beginning to thaw and so the goods from up-country can now begin to come down. I hope we shall soon have the convenience of some shipping. I have noted that I can draw on you when the bills of lading for goods are sent and orders given for their insurance.

And please write and tell me whether or not latten is used by your coppersmiths, so that I can act accordingly. At Amsterdam they consume at least 200 to 300 slb and I am sure you could use as much.\n Because of floodwater we have not been able to work for the last two or three wecks, but it is now beginning to fall.

    "TEXT": "Your letters of the r4th, 21st and 25th last have reached me safely, from which I have learned that you have sold and delivered the 997 bars of voyage-iron which I sent with Hans Michelsen. I have received the sale account, examined it, found it correct and debited you with the net proceeds of \u00a3188 8s 3d stg. which you mentioned in your letter, without prejudice. As you know perfectly well, the 3 per cent which you charge me relates to the sale of iron and to the remittance of bills of exchange as well, as was agreed with the late Mr Marescoe. You have undertaken to continue on the same conditions which you have confirmed in several letters, though I can quite believe that you did so precipitately. You will have debited the \u00a34 115 od for the 20 bars which Anders Beursen delivered short, although since I have received some information from the Crown galley I expect to be able to make good some of it.\n Ihave credited you with 30s for the blue waistcoat. I have received 150 slb of iron out of Varmland, but as it is of only ordinary quality I have not wanted to send it but thought of using it as ballast in our ships and sending it to Portugal where it can make RD 8 per slb. Pitch has fallen into diverse hands here and is exported to [England] by various people and then undersold. I have spoken to several and told them that a friend of mine wanted to lay out some money, but what can I say, seeing that there are various \u2018cladders\u2019 here who also want to do so. The same thing is beginning to happen with iron. There are some who, for cash down, are selling at 8 or even 12s liib. per slb below the ordinary price. It is also falling in price in Hamburg. If I can get it to Portugal before these others there might be no great loss\u2014time will tell.\n It is a good thing that the new duties in [England] on iron and other wares will not commence this year. The King here has also been thinking of raising the duty by 16 stuivers per slb, though so far it has not been done, but some small ships have had their exemption taken away and must now pay 8 stuivers more per slb, though the King has been petitioned about it. If any changes should occur we shall learn in due course. Thave obtained acceptance of the \u00a3100 remitted to Bex at Rotterdam at 36s 1g and today I got news from the widow of Libert Wolters that you had remitted her \u00a3188 for my account in two bills at 35s 3g, for which acceptance has been procured. I shall be glad to learn soon from Mr Bex what remains to be remitted to Amsterdam.\n Anders Beursen arrived here over three weeks ago without delivering to me the basket with 24 bottles of Spanish Canary. Before your letter of the 21st of April came the basket was delivered to someone else who thought that Jan Kreuger had sent it to him, and the customs official and some others have enjoyed some of the bottles. Nevertheless you have my thanks, seeing that there is no other way of demonstrating my gratitude from this country-town. Wherewith, my regards, &e.",

    "TEXT": "We received your letter of the 14th instant with the enclosure for Sweden which we have forwarded.\n Regarding the information you ask for concerning the goods of Jacob Reenstierna, we can tell you that the late Mr Marescoe, being asked by us to advance money on the goods which the said Reenstierna had sent him at our disposal, desired that we would permit him (in case of bad debts or being otherwise unable to recover his outlay) to re-draw on us, which we agreed to; but now that the said Reenstierna has asked us if he can reckon upon and dispose of the value of the goods which have just gone to you in London we seck to be freed from the liability of such debts, since they only concern Reenstierna, not us, and we could have justly refused Mr Marescoe\u2019s request because we were only obliged to cover his commission, not his debts. And although you say that no bad debts need be expected to arise from the sale of these goods, we trust that the debt duc from the widow Birckhead? will be collected and that you will confirm that we run no risk concerning any debt arising from the said Reenstierna\u2019s goods and that we need expect no retrospective demands or re-drafts. In that case we can allow the remaining advance to be credited to Reenstierna and paid according to his order. Mr Willem Momma wrote to us some time ago, that he was disinclined to send goods to London because of the poor prices and the length of time it took to recover debts; and Lord Reenstierna no longer sends any goods at our disposal to other places, in order (we believe) to save the commission-charges. And because of the hostility between this country and France he is sending much of his output to Hamburg where there is better business than here. We understand that the Lord Cronstr\u00e9m was here for only a few days before returning; Mr Louis Wolters is still here but is returning to Hamburg shortly, and it is believed that Mr Libert Wolters will then be coming back here.

Since then I have received yours of the 28th of July, 4th and 22nd of August and tst instant, which for lack of occasion I have not answered earlier. Thanks to your letters I fully understand what has been happening to trade [in London]. Business here is poor in general and as a result I have not had the courage to order anything and I am all the more reluctant because goods are so cheap that a good deal of cheating is going on by mixing bad stuff with the good. I have had proof of that by several consignments from you, the latest being with the campeachy wood which was not packed as it should have been. Every day I have to hear much complaint about it and there are many people in this city who will certainly never buy any more from me. It lacks any colour, as ifit had been ground and boiled out completely, just as one finds it when it has been baked in some great fire. In short, you have badly encumbered me, which makes me reluctant to order anything more. Today the East India Company are selling their goods in [London]. There is nothing to be done with pepper as it is so abundant that it is being undersold and will only yield a loss. Barbados sugar is definitely not required now that muscovadoes are so cheap that one can buy them for 8g in current money with 13 months to pay. One can get reasonably good [Barbados sugar] for s3\u00a2 at 13 months in current money which differs by 43 per cent from bank-money. I see that it is now down to 20s in [London] and that is for good quality. Inshort, I have no relish for any just now. However, I shall meanwhile expect a note now and again saying what is happening to that and other commodities. Oil has risen again here, but because I have been badly served by you on two occasions I am afraid to acquire any. It has soared from RD 52 to 62. Black ginger is at 12g with 13 months time; galls 41 to 42 ML at 13 months. The price-list states that there is a two-fold price for campeachy wood: please explain what that means. I have made a note of the way in which your bills of exchange will be signed.

    "TEXT": "Ilast wrote to you on the 12th of the month and since then have received yours of the 8th and 12th instant, by which I see that instead of 34 sacks of white ginger you have only loaded 24 in Hendrick Roys\u2019 ship. The invoice has been received and noted, but I have further observed that you have only bought 6 sacks of white at 70s, the rest being of another kind, at which Iam extremely astonished and upset because I emphatically ordered you long ago to buy 5.000 lb. at the lowest possible price and to lay out any credit balance on my account on white ginger, and only if none was to be had to get black ginger. You repeated my orders in your letters of the 18th and 25th of August, the rst, 8th and 12th of September. In your letter of August 25th you wrote that the best price at which you could get 4.000 to 5.000 Ib. of white was 68s; in the letter of September 1st you were still doing your best; in the letter of September 8th you wrote that, on the day before, white ginger was fetching 7os 6d on the Exchange, and in your letter of the 12th you say that there are not 100 sacks left in the whole city and that the last batch went for 72s 6d. Notwithstanding the fact that I gave you a free hand, and although the price in [London] has been 68s, 71s 6d and 72s 6d according to what you write, you failed to buy me any. I certainly never restricted you to any price so you ought to have been able to get hold of it as you promised. I have every reason to complain about you in this way. What is the point of writing to me with every letter that you had made a note about buying for me at the current price and in the meantime doing nothing about it? You can judge for yourself whether you have done well for me or badly. If you had complied with my order and bought white ginger it would have turned out very well because this sort of ginger is very scarce here and dear, so I am extremely vexed that you wasted this excellent opportunity and instead of white bought me black. However, I suppose I must have patience and credit you with the 20 sacks of brown ginger at 47s, 5 butts and 6 puncheons at 48s, and about 110 sacks at sos. I have made a note of them and trust that this batch will turn out to be exceptionally fine since you have paid such an exceptionally high price for it. Brown ginger is at a standstill here; there is plenty in stock and no demand. I shall expect an invoice and a bill of lading as soon as all my ginger is shipped, and I hope you have divided it between two ships. As for indigo and campeachy wood, you had better leave them alone. I must break off in haste, and cordially commend you to God\u2019s protection, &c. \n[P.S.] If you can get choice white ginger for 72s, or for 75s at the most, please buy me about 3.000 Ib. and send them here as soon as you can. I shall remit you the money and make good your outlay. As the East [India] Company has had its sale I think the exchange will fall considerably. Wherewith again, adieu.",

The ship is now entirely unloaded and is lying ready to depart, only it lacks a good cargo and nothing has appeared so far except 40 tons of currants to be shipped to England from Zante, but as that is too little we have not undertaken it. We see little prospect of getting any freight at present as the St George is short of halfits cargo and is looking for freight, and that is a capital ship in which one would rather load than in the Providence if there was anything. We expect a friend\u2019s letter shortly from Zante about another 20 to 30 tons of currants to be laden in the same way as the abovementioned 40 tons. If we could have them both together we would not wait for anything more in order to get the ship on its way, because we firmly believe that our friend would want more that R. pta. 20 per ton if the ship were to lie here a long time, costing money, just in order to supplement its cargo. We would send the cash and the barrels to Zante and urge our friend to obtain the best goods at the least possible price. We hope this will turn out to the satisfaction of your friends and that good business can be done with the currants, which have turned out to be very fine and dry this year. The price has not yet been settled. The proceeds of your goods, which will be coming in shortly, will serve for payment of your share of the currants. We will let you know what happens, and remain meanwhile, with cordial regards, &c.\n[P.S.] Since the earlier orders of the owners have been confirmed, to obtain at least 100 tons of freight, we dare not decide to take less for fear of incurring displeasure. We await further orders about what we are to do and meanwhile will do our duty in looking for some other good cargo. The new sacks of currants are selling here at D.84.

Iam glad that you have accepted my bills of exchange for Mr Hicbenaer, and I do not doubt you will do likewise with those to follow. I hope to learn by your next letter of Claes Molt\u2019s arrival.\n As regards what is happening to copper-wire and other brass ware, there can be no fall in prices for copper is rising more and more in Stockholm and is now held at 250 d.c.m. Herewith is a bill of lading for 4 barrels of pots and 2 barrels of black kettles, loaded for my account at Stockholm in the ship St Anna, captain Jacob Grys, and although it is stated there to be only Slb. 18.15 in weight it correctly weighs as follows: \n2 barrels of pots. Nos. 32, 33, marked WM a hed 9.00.00 \n2 barrels of pots, Nos. 34, 35, marked WM \u2018H\u2019 weighing net SIb. 8.14.16 \n2 barrels of black kettles, Nos. 36, 37, marked WM, weighing net 4.07.10 \nnet Slb. 22.02.06\nPlease get them insured for \u00a3300. The pots have been accurately made according to your design and ought to sell for \u00a37, although I am not binding you to a price. They are 14 to 15 inches large, or less. That two barrels are marked \u2018M\u2019 and two marked \u201cH\u2019 is because they contain pots made by two different master-craftsmen, so they can be distinguished, but I trust they are both equally good.\n This week there will be despatched to Norrk\u00e9ping for loading in the ship Graeflyck Huys de la Gardie, captain Gerrit Laurens, about 1.000 coils of wire and about 15 to 18 slb of pans, from the largest to the smallest, made according to your design, and if I hear that they are in demand I shall work on them diligently throughout the winter so that, God willing, I can provide you with a lot more in the spring.\n It may well be that Messrs Luce & Van Bommel] are expecting a large amount of copperwire, and I think it will be in Gerrit Laurens\u2019s ship. I understand that my brother is offended that you allowed his bills of exchange to be protested. What reason you had for doing that I do not know. The English are buying up iron in Stockholm at 31 d.c.m. per slb so that I perceive more profit in selling it here than by risking it across the seas. I shall be glad to know if latten is selling [in London] and I trust that the business of the farthings is not going ahead. If it does it will be to the great loss of the contractors. The brewing-plates ought not to sell for less than the wire, and as they are glutted with pitch and tar everywhere there will be little profit to be made in that trade.

Having heard nothing from you this letter will be brief and serves mainly to accompany the second copy of the bill for \u00a3250, in case you have lost the first. We hope you will have got it accepted and promptly paid when due\u2014but ifnot, you will know how to get it protested in [London]. Enclosed herewith goes a letter to the said Momma which you will please have passed on to him and procure an answer. Our friends, Paulus and David van Stetten of Augsburg, correspond with this Momma and remitted him some money towards the purchase of some goods (which we think were furs) and for some posts they have had no letter from him. In his last letter he wrote that he was going into the country because he was unwell but that as soon as he was better, the following week, he would be coming back to town. So they are afraid that he may have died or that his business is in a bad way, and have asked us to write to our correspondents about it to inform them about his condition and to draw on him \u00a3250 sterling as he still owes them \u00a3300 stg.\u2014 all which we have done in our previous letter, sending you the bill of exchange and enjoining you to do what was necessary. The Messrs Van Stetten, who are such great friends of ours that we cannot refuse them, now further request us to warn our friends in [England] in case this Abraham Momma, with his business in a bad way, does not accept the bill of exchange though the goods which they ordered have not been sent. In that event, they have sent us the enclosed power of attorney written in Latin, wherein they give us complete authority to act on their behalf and settle matters with him, together with a clause allowing us to substitute whoever we want where they have left our name blank, in case it should be necessary. So we have substituted your name, to demand an account from the estate of the said Momma on behalf of the Messrs Van Stetten. You must forgive us for taking this liberty but since we have no other correspondents in [London] we could not call upon anyone else. We shall be greatly obliged to you and will wait for you to send your expenses and other charges regarding this business. It may be that the man is perfectly well and there is nothing to worry about, in which case it will not be necessary to the use the power of attorney, but please hold it in [London] until further order. Meanwhile, keep us informed how matters stand, forgiving us for the trouble. Keep a separate note of the postage of these letters so that we can recover it from our friends.\n As regards trade, we know of little to say. If war should break out between France and the Dutch we believe there will be changes in the prices of many goods. Ginger is at a standstill. We have checked the account of the 41 sacks of black ginger, found it correct and recorded our agreement. We now await the bill of lading. The wind continues steadily east so no ships can come and Jacob Giese will also be driven back should God allow him to continue his journey. This commodity is too high in price, one should keep one\u2019s hands clear of it. As we said in our last letter, we want no more ginger or indigo. The price of sugar has increased a little and if you can obtain a good batch you may spend 22 to 224s. We shall now wait to hear what you advise. Fine Barbados cotton is no use to us at more than 43d. We shall be glad to hear whenever the ships arrive from the Levant at what price galls are offered, as well as Ardasse, fine camel yarn, Smyrna or Acre cotton and also what further developments there are with indigo and ginger.

Backer soon appears, you will be able to recover your money from him and do all that is required when their payment falls due.\n Since the prohibition of wine imports? the exchange on France has fallen heavily here, so I can see from your letters that one can draw from London more advantageously.

Talso informed you that I have got into a dispute with Capt. Jacob Gries over the freight of the 11 barrels! of ginger, which I now confirm. He claims that there are 4 butts to a last and that 6 puncheons were also reckoned to equal one last, just as sugar butts and puncheons always are. But I understand that one last is reckoned to weigh 4.000 |b.,? while a butt of ginger only weighs 600 to 700 |b. and a puncheon about 400 |b. As against that a butt of sugar amounts to at least 1.100 or even 1.500 Ib. and a puncheon of sugar between 700 and 1.000 |b. But he insists that he had expressly stipulated and agreed with you and that you had accordingly instructed him that he might take them on such conditions. Whatever the truth is, please inform me in answer to this, for he will not concede one stuiver, which I consider unreasonable since in this way I shall have to pay nearly 3 or 4 times as much freight as I should. In future, I beg you not to send any more ginger in casks. Here we are always accustomed to have it in sacks, for which we must buy linen and have it sewn, which causes great inconvenience and expense.\n There is no consumption of ginger here. I shall be most grateful if you will tell me what is happening in [England] with regard to silk, and beg you to find out as much as you can and as carefully as you dare what quantities are coming to Smyrna of Ardasse and Legee [silks] and also what the prices are likely to be.

From the last I understand that the insurance on the ship Het Graefelyck Huys de la Gardie has been completed for \u00a3900 at 4 per cent, \u00a3250 at 5 per cent and \u00a3350 at 6 per cent, amounting with expenses and commission to \u00a379 18s, for which I have credited you. In view of the high premium I trust the ship will have arrived in safety with the others. I could not order any insurance from you before the cargo was loaded and I also believe that nobody else has insured except my brother Jacob. I trust the goods will sell as they ought. Copper has risen to RD.76 at Hamburg, and brass ought to fetch proportionately. It is true, as you say, that while goods are coming in such abundance the retailers ought not to see the extent to which they come. Even more, this ought to be kept in mind by the wholesalers who ought not to sell for less than it costs to make. Otherwise it would be better for the works to close down, just as those at Liibeck and Hamburg must now do, for while they get only 6 to 8 rixdollars per slb more than the present price of brass they cannot keep on going. So it is only you who can alter things, and I repeat what I have said before\u2014I would rather that you leave goods unsold for 6 months than sell them for 6 months credit.\n Ihave no doubt that you will do your best for me. As for the farthings, I have said before that it is a most damaging contract for the Cronstr\u00e9ms, as well as for all others who have contracted to deliver copper or plates. I would not have sent the last lot of latten unless it had been convenient to send with the other goods, and as the amount is not large it will be easily used up by the copper-smiths.\n Herewith I have drawn on you 6 bills to pay \u00a3750 to my sons Isaac and Jacob Momma or order at the end of February\u2014one of \u00a3200, one of \u00a3150 and four each of \u00a3 100\u2014which you will please accept and return to them so they can use them whenever they need them. Nothing remains but to send you heartiest regards, &c.",

I shall do something if I can count on some profit.\n Regarding the cargo sent with Cornelis Jansen in 1660, I would like to see how the account stands and beg you to send mea copy out here because I have much to do here and must spend the winter between here and Konigsberg. I gave up my account with chief commissioner Struve? in February 1661 and avoided dealing with him any further because he is a very variable and changeable fellow and his commissions have done me more harm than good, as the Lord God and other decent people know to be true. I shall now do business on my own account, so I beg you asa friend to keep me informed about what I have written above at the earliest opportunity. If there is anything in which I can serve you, you have only to ask. Send my letters under cover of Carlos [?] or simply by the post. It has been very stormy here for some days and many voyagers have come to harm and the high seas have also done much damage\u2014for your information; wherewith, my cordial regards, &c. \n[P.S.] English tin is selling here at 13 guilders per centner.

If 10.000 Ib. could be brought here at once I could sell it at Konigsberg to the Russians and Poles for a good price and get flax and hemp to return with the ship that brings it. Weights here are 12 per cent heavier than at Konigsberg, so one has a 12 or 13 per cent profit on the weights at Konigsberg. The licence is 13 gros. 3-band flax costs 4 guilders 10 gros; Paternoster or Littauisch flax 5 or 54 guilders per stone of 40 |b., Konigsberg-weight. The flax is well prepared and properly washed.

    "TEXT": "Our most recent letter was by the last post, in which we told you not only to buy us 4.000 to 5.000 lb. of good, white scraped ginger at the best price possible but that the black ginger had better be left alone since the price was running so high, and that if you bought Barbados indigo it must be absolutely choice and saleable stuff.\n In this letter we only want to say that there have been no letters from London today so we do not know if any changes are occurring in commodities. We want to know in your next letter what you have been able to do for us regarding the white, scraped ginger. As for the black, we shall think about it for a while since the price is too high and the sale of it begins to diminish, so the price will fall again as it is already beginning to do. With regard to galls, everything is very quiet; as for cotton and Ardasse, there is no demand. Of indigo we hope you have bought us nothing since you must have also heard in [England] of the arrival of the flota in Spain, very richly laden with great quantities of indigo and campeachy wood. For people well know that when great amounts of some merchandize arrive the price always falls. Doubtless you have considered that, and we shall be glad to hear that before you saw this letter you had not bought us any. Please leave it alone since there is no profit to be got from it. We find that the most recent letters mention Barbados sugars as being at 2135 to 215, by which they think they must be at their lowest; but we doubt that, because there is so little consumption of refined sugar and unrefined is in such poor demand that there is a rebate of 82 per cent on 54g in current or common money (which differs by 43 per cent from bank money) which is a miserable price. We do not think it has ever been as low as 53g banco before, except for a short while before leaping strongly upwards. And we recall that it was once at 20s and 193s in [London] and the exchange was more favourable than it is now, so it may well fall back to 20s or below, which would not be strange in view of the high rate of exchange and poor sales through lack of consumption. Seeing in the latest letters that 5 or 6 ships from Barbados were unloading, take the risk of finding for us a nice little consignment of really choice stuff, which must not be dirty, and if you can get it for 215 6d at the highest, free on board, you may buy us ro butts and send it here under our usual mark. Once before we had a batch which was in small barrels of about 300 Ib. per barrel, which was very white and completely dry: we would be glad to have similar, or even better, goods. Ordinary coarse stuff is no use to us, even for 20s or below; we have fixed the price rather high in order to have good quality. You may watch out for us to see if you can obtain such a fine consignment of 10.000 to 11.000 Ib. but if it is not obtainable, let it go. We remit with this, for our account, \u00a3200 stg. at 2 usances and [blank] days in a bill of Samuel Free payable by Mr William Robinson. Please procure the necessary and let it serve towards the purchase of our goods. Wherewith we send you our most cordial regards, &c.",

Please credit his account and let me have a statement so that I can write to Sweden and tell my nephew Matthias Trip how much iron he is to order. I also asked you to keep me informed if any of my creditors! should not pay up promptly for the iron which has been delivered to them. In such case I would reimburse you for any such money you may have advanced to me. Meanwhile, I trust that the amount which was due on the 1st of April has been received and beg you to tell me who is still owing money and how much the sum amounts to.\n I have written today to my nephew Matthias Trip at Stockholm to find out if one can profitably trade to London. According to the latest letters the Swedes are raising the duty on iron by 2 or 3 dollars to 31 d.c.m., but I think that when they get news from here about the war the price of iron will return to its old level. Iron prices are weak here since none can be exported and Sweden must follow suit unless all the English come and buy a lot and thus inflate the price. Other commodities, on the contrary, have risen very considerably. Let me know from time to time the price of iron in England for my guidance. \n[P.S.] Ihave received your letter of 29 March together with 2 bills of exchange, each of \u00a3100, for which I shall obtain acceptance.",

In reply, your brother John Lethieullier has revoked the purchase of pepper for his account and we shall do the same for yours. Indeed, it really must be done because that commodity is daily held at D.100 to D.103 without any prospect of abatement. These wars endanger shipping to such an extent that nothing can be brought from [England] or Holland without great risk. If France fails to obtain the pepper which is known to have just arrived at Lisbon in the ship from the East Indies it is likely to come to Italy which may well cause some fall in prices since this country is well-supplied with it and it is only these troubles which stiffen the price. But if the war continues for long and the only pepper coming to Italy comes out of France the price may rise higher, which God forbid!\n There is no change in the price of lead apart from the last purchases we informed you of. Since then it has been at D.70 but there are no buyers and there is a large amount in town. Therefore, on the arrival of the Blackmore (which God grant may arrive soon in safety) we think it advisable to dispose of your so pieces at the highest possible price. We do not see any prospect of any great alteration in the immediate future. At Leghorn it fetches D.314, which is much less than here. We will be glad to hear from you about this, if you think it worthwhile. Large quantities of lead are being brought from Germany now and are selling at D.70.\n Since you have procured acceptance of the D.235 which we remitted to you we do not doubt that you will be duly paid. As soon as the rest of what is due on your account is received we shall remit it immediately. Bortolo Marinoni owes for lead which came from the Coninck David. We have presssed him diligently and will let you know when we succeed. The Sommission which came from Lisbon with sugar is loading oil here. Muscovado sugar fetches D.82 with 4 months time; powdered sugars D.12 to D.14, according to quality. There is very little left in town in the wholesalers\u2019 hands since it has been mostly bought up by engrossers. Barbados sugar, D.6; pepper-powder, D.11 with 10 per cent tare; oil at Gallipoli is D.133 free on board. In other commodities there is no change and from overseas we have heard nothing of importance, so we shall break off here, remaining, &c.\n[P.S.] We see no prospect of doing anything in your commission for pepper.

As a result, the money from your company and that of Madame Marescoe remains undisposed of. Various towns and places are surrendering without resistance and one can clearly discern that it has been done in collusion with some great ones who seek to change the government and possibly the religion of this state.

Since then we have received yours of the 7th, 11th and r4th instant with the following remittances on behalf of your company, vizt.;\n\u00a3150@ 34s 2g} 27th el B eI on Ott[avi]o Franc[is]co & Nic[ol]o And. Tousinc, due on the \u00a3100@ 34518 on Roeland Cockey, falling due on the 30th instant; and for the account of Madame Marescoe \u00a3750 @ 335 11g, namely: \u00a3300 on Phil, de Surmont {200 on Eduart Vandervoort falling due on 3 July. \u00a3150 on Joan Hervey Muysken, & {\u00a3100 on Jacob Derson\nFor all these payment has been procured but only through the bank because payment cannot be demanded outside the bank (as you ordered). Many people have removed their funds from the bank and are daily doing so, and as one cannot be altogether sure that there is cnough some of them are buying their bank-money at 24 and 3 per cent loss. However, we cannot discover that there is any danger of the bank running short of money unless by plundering, against which we believe the civic authorities will take good care. We would have much preferred that you had drawn back these remittances in view of the loss which you will suffer by returns at the present high rate of exchange. However, it is beginning to weaken a little since our last letter.\n The Messrs Momma have presented us with their bill of exchange for the \u00a3300 which still remains due to them but we found it inadvisable to take it at such a high price. Gold is being exchanged at a Io per cent premium. Yesterday we gave Capt. Peter Hunt of the Boston Merchant two sacks of pieces of eight for the account of Mrs Marescoe\u2014vizt. one sack of Mexican reals weighing 65 marks 5 ounces, and one sack of Seville reals weighing 45 marks, which we have lumped together in the bill of lading as 1.000 pieces although, through lack of time, we were unable to check them. With our next letter we hope to send the bill of lading and advise you of the amount. We are informed that no rixdollars or pieces of eight are obtainable in Rotterdam and we do not think it advisable to send any that way for the time being. We have looked for goods to send in London-bound ships but have not been able to obtain any yet. As soon as we are given permission we shall arrange some goods to consign to you and with every opportunity of English shipping will send you some bank-rixdollars. Herewith we return the bill of exchange for \u00a3100 sterling on Coymans & Voet with the protest for lack of acceptance which we forgot to send by the last post because of these present troubles. We also remit to you for the account of Charles Godyn \u00a3600 sterling in 4 bills, of \u00a3200, \u00a3150, \u00a3150, and \u00a3100, drawn by Willem Momma on May 12th to be received from yourself on July 31st. Please credit Godyn\u2019s account and reserve the money until further order.\n Pepper was selling lately at r9g; nutmegs at 45 to 47 stuivers; wherewith our heartiest regards, &c.\n [P.S.] We thank you for your friendly offer of help in these misfortunes. We intend to wait and see what outcome the Lord God will grant.",

Thereupon I have decided to consign to you my own ship, called De Hoop, which sailed for London from here only a few days ago. The captain is Simon Leysten, with whom I have loaded a quantity of iron and deals for my own account, as you can see from the enclosed invoice. At first I had addressed them to Mr William Strang of London but have now come to a different decision and herewith direct them to you, requesting you to arrange their reception and to sell them to my greatest advantage. I have given orders to Mr Strang that, if the ship arrives before the letter and is unloaded, he should transfer all my goods to you for my account, but if not the captain has orders to deliver to you. Mr Strang will hand over all the papers regarding this, for there are some parcels of iron which belong to other friends at London who are to shoulder the freight charges according to the signed bills of lading, whereofa detailed specification goes herewith. And as the captain is a bit dimwitted? please give him some help in case he makes a mistake about the freights, which you will be so kind as to receive and credit to my account, holding it for my further disposal. Lord Lillienhoff has also assured me that whenever I send you goods, even up to \u00a32.000-worth, I shall be able to draw up to three-quarters of the value in return for reasonable interest. I trust that you will allow me to enjoy such accommodation, about which I await your answer. I shall thereupon send you further ships\u2019 cargoes such as Iron, pitch and tar, as well as of hemp, so that you will have quite enough goods of mine in your hands,\n If Captain Lysten is already with you Mr William Strang has orders to send him on to Scotland, and as he began this correspondence he may as well finish it, and on this occasion you necd not incommode yourself. I hope that Mr Strang will not refuse you the goods in the ship De Hoop if it has already arrived and been unloaded before my countermanding orders. I shall send youa letter of attorney by the next post so that ifhe will not do it willingly he must deliver to you by the force of such a letter; wherewith, awaiting any relevant news, I remain, &e.",

Campeachy wood has fallen here to 17 ML, current money; pepper is at 183g; Barbados sugar, 53 to 6g; Aleppo galls 41 to 42 ML per 100 lb; new currants ML 28; indigo Guatemalo is at ros flem. and Barbados indigo at 84s flem. We are glad to hear that Ardasse has risen, because we are already supplied with some.\n You were advised that if you could get fine brown ginger for 40s or below, free on board, you could buy 6.000 Ib. for us, but we are relieved to see that there is little or no prospect of it for we immediately had letters saying that it would be ordered for us if it could be obtained. Because of the number of capers which will be putting to sea from Holland nothing will be getting through.\n It isa good thing that Farrington and Claypool have paid their bill. We hope the rest has also come in. We will let you know soon what we want done with our proceeds. Friendliest regards, &c.",

Henceforth we hope there will be some further demand, and if any good opportunity presents itself we shall not fail to push forward your $0 pieces as best we can: of this you may be fully assured, and we shall keep you informed of what we are able to achieve.\n Asa result of the news, that 14 ships have arrived in Holland from the East Indies, pepper is quite dead and is valued by some at only D.76, but we will not sell the batch we have being of opinion that it will improve since it can scarcely be brought from England or Holland, and the selling-season is nearly here. We shall adjust our prices here according to the prices the Company sets in England. If you decide to send us some supplies at the first opportunity, as with the lead, we do not doubt that we will do some good business.

We beg you kindly to continue to take care of our interests, and we urge this most strongly. Thank you for accepting our drafts of \u00a3480 sterling and we do not doubt that you have accepted our last of \u00a3500 at 1 month and \u00a3500 at 2 months after sight, as well as the \u00a3200 at 2 months drawn 3 days ago payable to the order of Mr Teixera. We have been happy to learn of the safe arrivals of captains Hans Meyer, Hans Michielsen and Johan Kruse with our iron\u2014for which God be thanked! But we are sorry to hear that iron prices are falling in [England]. We urge you to continue to protect our interests and we rely on you to waste no time in selling our iron.\n We have also received a bill of lading of 20 hogsheads of Barbados sugar loaded aboard Jacob Erick\u2019s ship. May God protect him and bring him in safety. On his arrival we shall unload the sugar and do our best to benefit your account, which we believe was your intention, for we cannot take it on our account. It will be a very long time in yielding any payments as the Sugar Company is glutted with too much stock, and it will scarcely sell or be paid for in less than 10 or 12 months. However, as we have interests in the above-mentioned company we shall do the best we can to help.\n We are reasonably well-supplied with iron, which we are thinking of sending to you if only the duty were removed, as every one hopes it will be if God grants peace. Please let Messrs Bartholotti & Rihel of Amsterdam have RD 5.000 out of the proceeds for our goods, which they are insuring, ifand when they are sold. And as our iron- and wire-works are very burdensome and we are overloaded with iron and wire which we cannot turn into money in these difficult times, we request that you give us sympathetic support in these circumstances and accommodate us as far as you can without prejudicing yourselves\u2014i.c. by allowing us to draw on you for 8 or 10 months the balance to which our goods amounts to, payable to the order of Manoel Teixera. He can oblige us, and we have formed a special friendship with him.\n We calculate that the amount of iron, including what is in the ship De Patientia (which, God permitting, will have arrived before this)\ntotals | 2.250slb from which must be deducted 250slb in the wrecked Anders Beursen, 2.000 slb_ which should be able to render about RD_ 14.000. RD 7.800 for the wire in Hans Meyer, totals RD 21.800; from which about \u00a31.680 sterling has beendrawnis RD 7.000 To Messrs Bartholotti & Rihel: RD 5.000 RD 12.000 RD 12.000\nRD ___ 9.800 approximately should remain. If we could now draw RD 7.000 as we have before it would be an act of great friendship, and as for the remainder we would reckon it as the RD 2.500 due from the Lord Leyonbergh. Next week the following will be cleared, namely: an obligation dated 27 July from Abraham Wolters to pay at 6 months for RD 397.25; also an assignment on the bank to pay on 29 November 2.400 dollars copper money, and 3.409 dollars copper money to be paid in cash. The rest will be paid next week with an obligation from Caspar Robbert though without prejudice to us. Of these, the obligation from Abraham Wolters has come in and the others from Caspar Robbert and the bank.\n We have seen with nothing but great astonishment what you say about our wire, which is nevertheless in as great demand here and in Holland, Hamburg and France as any other. We beg you to take the proceeds, for the difference is quite considerable, and they must be wicked people who refer to it in this way. We urge you to take care of our interests. As regards the seizure of the ship De Dolphin, Mr Caspar Robbert will write to you more fully, and the King has got the Admiralty to write to the envoy Leyonbergh about the goods.! I again commend to you the reclamation of my small consignment, since it is hardly important enough for the envoy to do it. If the Lord permits you may easily procure my half, for it is only some varnish which I need for my house, wherewith our cordial regards, &c. \n[P.S.] We have spent about RD.so, and we hope that it will be acceptable to you to rely on your discretion in our difficulties.",

We have never before witnessed such bad times, and because so many Barbados ships have been captured at sea there is much undercutting of Barbados goods, so one simply cannot compete with them to make it worth paying out any money.\n It isa good thing that you made a note to buy for us \u00a3200 stg.-worth of good black ginger (if it can be had at 40s or below, free on board) as well as 20 sacks of fine Aleppo galls, if they can be had for sos per cwt. However, as galls are standing at 53 to 54s it is no use thinking that anything can be done with them. However, some other friends of ours hold out the hope that brown ginger may well fall to 38s. You will know how to procure them advantageously for us, and when you have done so divide them between two Hamburger or other free ships and send them here, giving us due notice by which captain they are sent\u2014but please do not send them in English ships.\n Since indigo seems likely to be at reasonable prices please also buy for us about \u00a3130 stg.~ worth of fine Jamaican or Caribbean indigo which looks saleable and of high quality, if you can get it for 3s 1dor 3s 2d at most, free on board. And please make sure that it is not of small, dirty pieces to which people strongly object: a weak blue is of no use to us. You can send it to us here under our customary mark. Pepper still fetches 162g here but vendors are happy to deliver it for 16g at 6 months time and good quantities are sold. The world is full of pepper and demand is very small. We shall have to wait and see; we believe it may perhaps be sold more cheaply by some individuals, or it may stay at the same price\u2014time will tell. 20 to 215 for sugar is certainly not dear although there is nothing to be done with it here. Nevertheless, if we had room in our own houses we would order some but they are full up with goods and unless we hire a warehouse, which is very expensive here, we can not have any. We are also well-supplied with Ardasse and it is cheaper here than in [England]. Meanwhile we shall be glad to learn more about what is happening with one thing or another so that we can act accordingly. Friendly regards, &c.",

Since then I have received yours of the 13th and 23rd past from which I see that you have procured insurance on Gerret Laurens\u2019s ship of \u00a3400 at 4% per cent and \u00a3950 t 5 per cent. I hope you have since been able to procure the remainder. Ihave also received the current account which you closed on the 13th of August by which there is due to you \u00a35.237 15s 8d. lagree with that, but find that you have brought together into the outstanding debts due on recent sales old debts amounting to \u00a31.594 16s 2d. New debts cannot be mixed up with old debts. I also find that Anthony Hatch, Skepper, Slutter* and Sampson delay somewhat. I hope they have paid up since then, and please ensure that no new debts are put down with the old ones. Also, specify how much each person owes without lumping together two or three persons unless they are in partnership and the one is liable for the other. Prices are bad and insurance costly so it does not help to make bad debts. Please take care therefore, as you have until now. You seem to believe that my goods have been fully drawn against so I must calculate according to your own account what brass has been sent to you,\nvizt.\u2014 remaining of the old Slb 20.02.02 with the Jupiter, Jacob Fix 152.16.00 with the St Anna, Jacob Grys I01.15.00 with Gerret Laurens III.01.16 Slb 385.14.18 which I calculate to yield about 1.022 cwt. at \u00a35 15s over and above expenses: Jo 6 5.876 10 0 For the 159 slb of iron in Jacob Grys, about 263 10 9 6.140 0 0\nIt is true that the iron ought not to be included in the calculation because it is not insured, but without the same it would not differ by more than \u00a3100\u2014\u00a3200, if you have accepted the \u00a3800 which has just been drawn on Gerret Laurens. The great decline in prices goes beyond what I had expected, and I had hoped to have \u00a3400\u2014\u00a3 500 more in proceeds in hand. Ido not doubt that you will accept this \u00a3800 as well as what I have drawn against the goods in Erick Anderson Boy. You can expect no more this year. My view is that your prices are now at their lowest point and that with winter coming they will begin to fetch more. [have noted that you sold, in addition to the 250 coils of wire on 2 August to Wathing & Woodfield, another 350 coils to the same, all at \u00a36 tos with 4 months time; to John Skepper 20 brewing-plates, cwt. 10.1.8 lb, of pots at \u00a36 10s and 12 cwt. of latten at \u00a36 with 6 months time; and to Grice the remaining pots from the Jupiter as well as 23 cwt. of latten at \u00a36 10s in 6 months, and this account you have put with the outstanding debts due on the old account.\n I have now received by the last post in my sons\u2019 letters news that Capt. Jacob Grys was intercepted and brought in to Rotterdam by capers, although I hope he will soon be released as petitioned for, Ifnot, it would be advisable if you sent over the policy on the brass, which is insured only against the risks of the sea, with a simple attestation that the iron is not insured. My sons will probably have written to you about it. I hope to have better news about Gerret Laurens and Erick Anderson Boy, God willing. Regards, &c.",

If one sells a batch in that way, even if it is a lot, the price is bound to decline. Nevertheless, as I really see no present prospect of much improvement I am forced to think that one must go along with it. I trust that with these low prices the said iron will now sell rather better and in the coming year fetch rather more once it is better known.\n Regarding the accounts of these ships: I cannot see that much iron of importance will be shipped out of Sweden to London. It is not merely because of these low prices, heavy freightcharges and expenses but also because there are no more ships to lade, all the large ships having been already despatched. It looks as if the increase in the toll will be set aside. I have received news from the Sound that Capt. Hendrick Mattson has arrived safely there\u2014for which the Lord be thanked.

What is more, I know that it is good.\n At Bordeaux there is lying a ship lading for London, belonging to His Excellency Gustaff Soop,? named De Pasientia and about 70 lasts in burthen. On board is [the body of] the captain who was drowned at [the Isle of] Wight, so it is being conveyed by the mate, and as he is unknown to me please be helpful to him and do what he may want you to do and receive the freight money. Furthermore, handle his account as if you were the captain and consider where it would be most advisable to send him, where there might be some serviceable freight. Iam writing to him herewith to follow your orders in every particular. Please let me know at once how much it costs to export from Bordeaux. He wrote to me from Bordeaux that he was well and had agreed upon 42s per vat.\n People are trying to persuade me (although I simply cannot understand it) that Swedish ships must state in their passes where they are going to and what they are carrying. That may well be true if they are coming from Stockholm, but if they are sailing for other places it is quite impossible, because they cannot know what country they are going to before they have acquired a cargo, and by then it is too late to write for a pass. Please let me know how you understand it, and whether or not a captain, sailing from Stockholm to London with a pass saying he is coming with pitch and tar from Stockholm to London, may then sail with the same pass from London to Bordeaux and from there back to London or Hamburg? Herewith comes a note from Johannes de Geer about the iron he has sent you this year. The ship Drie Salmen, captain Jan Cornelis, is likely to come here from Stockholm, being loaded there with iron and 528 coils of copper-wire by Johannes de Geer and Abraham Wouters and consigned to Steven de Geer. Allin all, it has 2.732 slb of iron and 49 slb of wire. Please have it registered in London as well as in Scotland if you judge it likely to journey there. The ship De Coning David, captain Hendrick Matson, with its cargo of timber taken aboard in Norway for the ship\u2019s account, is to sail to either Bordeaux or Lis as the captai thinks advisable. aie ee ete orders to enquire if there are any letters paces for him if he should be driven into the Downs by contrary winds, so that if by chance timber\u2014that is, deals\u2014are expensive with you and likely to fetch much more than at Bordeaux, then he might as well go to London. So please write to your agent to keep an eye open for the said captain, and decide whether you consider it a good idea for the cargo to be unloaded in London, or in Portsmouth or [the Isle of] Wight, where it might sell readily and a return freight of bottles? for Bordeaux might present itself. Please deliberate with the captain about what might be best to do. Furthermore, I strongly urge upon you the reclamation of my goods in the Muscovite ship,* of which I send the invoice for your fuller information. I trust that everything is in hand and that you, through your agents, will be able to recover them. The expenditure which I mentioned previously you will know best how to manage and bestow as time and opportunity permits.\n Herewith also goes a note to Lord Leyonberg which will likewise be useful, as occasion serves.\n Our Ambassadors have arrived safely at Rotterdam. I am thinking of going to The Hague shortly and if anything of importance turns up I shall let you know. May the Lord give usa good peace, to whose protection I commend you, &c.",

    "TEXT": "Since my departure from Stockholm about a fortnight ago I have found here several of your letters, some written in partnership as well as individually. However, I have seen, not without great shock and astonishment, that you have neither honoured my drafts nor Mr Beck\u2019s, which is in direct contradiction of your own letter in which you wrote that you would not satisfy the \u00a31.700 to Mr Neltorp? but that I could expect to draw \u00a31.000 on you at 2, 4 and 6 months time. I have now followed your instructions and given orders to Mr Beck in Hamburg to draw that much on you. Now comes your latest letter, refusing payment! As I wrote to you, with my resources otherwise disposed I really do not know how I am to interpret this, and I cannot guess what you intend by it. I certainly intend to have control over things myself, so I must ask you, in the friendliest way, to let me know at once how much of my resources are disposed of and to whom, so that I can have a balanced account. I must tell you, truthfully, I do not know where I am, standing here between two fires. I proceeded on the basis of your letters and arranged my plans accordingly, but\u2014God help me\u2014find myself mistaken, so that Iam thrown off my bearings.? You have truly done me a great wrong by this, for which I must appeal to God. I beg you, just let me know how my assets have been disposed of and whether they can be recovered. Whether or not you have paid others without orders you will know best; I do not know, because I employed you as my agent. When, for the first time, you would not pay the money to Mr Neltorp it was much the same as protesting the bill of exchange, and after that you gave me instructions to draw up to \u00a31.000 on you, which I did, and gave you no other orders except to satisfy Mr Beck. If you have paid money to anyone else it is without any instructions from me and is no concern of mine. It is quite unreasonable that a Christian man should let down another in such a way, and it is not the way that merchants behave. You have not the least right in the world to control my money as you think fit, without my orders. Be assured, this has struck me so hard that I and my whole house could be ruined by it, for which you will have to answer severely before God. My servant in Scotland informs me that he too will remit to you for my account, if you give order to draw upon him, \u00a3300 and afterwards more. I request you then to send me an account of how much is owing to me and how much I can draw on you, for I cannot now continue my journey before I have your answer. Patience! Ihave no doubt that you will show some Christian kindness and consider how I am dealt with since I rely so much on your letter; and now, since it is so entirely out of my hands, I must leave off. I shall look forward to your answer at the earliest, and remain, with regards, &c.\n[P.S.] I beg you, on the receipt of this letter to give Mr Beck order that he may draw on you, or that you will immediately remit as much money as is due to him, for before that is done I cannot set out on my journcy or pursue my plans. This is now of great importance to me, sol beg you to bear that in mind, and I shall await your reply forwarded from Mr Beck. For God\u2019s sake, deal with me as a Christian so that I shall not be further obliged to appeal to God and to molest you with my letters of lamentation, specifically awaiting your answer and the net sum due to me so that I can govern myself accordingly.",

Iam, furthermore, not intending to trade with any one other than you, since it is with you that my first proposal was arranged. However, about 3 or 4 days ago an English merchant questioned me whether I would contract with him for all my voyage iron in the coming year, but I do not want to do so while Tam doing business with you. Therefore I shall wait to hear what you have achieved with the company and if they have no great desire to reach agreement you ought not to press them as I have no intention of giving my iron for less than \u00a314 15s. Now I shall wait to hear your answer whether my proposal to deliver iron for the Company account will be able to go ahead.\n I hope to hear by your next of the arrival of Capt. Pyper. Since his departure from the Sound I have heard nothing from him, so I hope he has sailed in to Norway. De Vliegende Wolff has passed the Sound\u2014may the Lord God guide both of them in safety. My maximum advantage is commended to you, as always, and I hope you will obtain \u00a315 for the voyage iron and \u00a314 for the other. Greetings, &c.",

    "TEXT": "As by the grace of God the old year is ending and a new year beginning, so I must wish you much happiness, well-being and success, as well as all the prosperity and contentment you may wish for in everything you may undertake in this and many coming years, beseeching God to grant you above all everything that can make for salvation. My last letter to you was on the 29th of December, 1674, with which I sent you the second copy ofa bill of exchange for \u00a3120 sterling endorsed to you so that you can procure payment in time. I have since received yours of the 18th and 29th of December, by which I sce that you have bought for my account 1 bale of Ardasse at ros 6d on condition that I can receive the drawback of half the customs duty, which\u2014according to you\u2014means that it will cost me about ros 4d net. But that is quite expensive enough, and I fail to see that you have looked out for my interests in making this purchase, for others tell me that they can get good Smyrna Ardasse at 10s, and Aleppo at 9s 9d, which differs considerably from your purchase. This is not the way to go about things. You say that it is worth 4d more than usual: time will tell\u2014 particularly if it were re-sold in England and you were able to make 4d above the current price which you paid for it! But you say in your last letter that, in the event of re-export, I can recover half the customs-duty, so it must follow that if it remains over there I can recover nothing, and so I cannot discover what advantage you have obtained. I also cannot see what reason you had to make this purchase so hastily, since you yourself say that the ships were not yet unloaded. With your next letter I shall expect the account so that I can make a record of it\u2014for there is no remedy for what is done, and one must be patient. God be praised, Capt. Boys Ipsen arrived here some days ago, as you will have heard from others. I shall procure the delivery of the bales! which you sent and let you know how I find them in my next. Since you loaded nothing more in him there is nothing else of yours for which he needs to sign. You did well not to buy anything more of this kind since it is being maintained at a quite indecently high price, and if one makes a purchase disadvantageously one cannot expect any great profit. But I do not understand why you say that you want to buy 2 further bales of Begbesar, because I have given no new order for Begbesar since the 2 bales sent with Ipsen were bought, so please buy nothing. But, if the 2 bales of superfine Angora have not been obtained yet, please buy them as best you can though not for more than 5s or 5s 6d, or in their place get 2 of the ordinary fineness of the kind sent with Hendrick Weever, for although it is not entirely white it is good and very similar and I used to prefer to use it. However, as you say there is no lack of it, it is best that I leave you to use your own judgement. It is not freezing here yct, so\u2014God permitting \u2014W. Oloffsen can still get here, and I should be glad to have my 2 bales of Angora.\n Enclosed herewith goes the second copy of the bill of exchange for \u00a3100, payable by Caspar Kaus on the last day of this month and endorsed for payment to you. Please procure payment in due course and place it to my account. As for what is to be done with it\u2014I mean to say, with regard to other things\u2014it is good that the whale-fins are still unsold. They should fetch more next spring since this week (God help us) four train-oil refineries were caught in the fire and, together with much equipment and train-oil, 100.000 Ib. of whale-fins were destroyed, the damage being estimated at about RD 50.000. May God comfort the afflicted. This misfortune will not make that commodity any cheaper in [England]. Please let me know how much duty you were able to recover on the first consignment of whale-fins and add to it what you agreed on for warchouse rent, so that I can make a note of it, for I would rather not confuse it with the other consignment. Since indigo is likely to fall it is good that you are not in a hurry to buy any. As for the proceeds of the whale-fins, I shall let you know ina later letter what I have decided to do with them. I hope you have also been cautious in going about to procure a parcel of white, scraped ginger for it seems likely to fall further in price. You can see that sooner than I can and will surely have acted accordingly. Thank you for the news about the [doicapi?] of Naples\u2014it will be most useful. T hope you have sent my current account. If not, let it be done. Thank you for your New Year wishes and may God confirm them in return. With hearty regards, &c. \n[P.S.] The \u00a3150 drawn by you payable to the brothers Du Pr\u00e9 falls due on the 3rd instant, but since the Bank is closed as usual from the end of December to the 14th instant it cannot be paid any earlier but it will then be promptly done, unless you hear otherwise. Iam obliged to you for the safe receipt of the letters from Barbados. C.B.",

Then all seagoing commerce from this country to the Baltic will come to a standstill and it will only remain open for England, so one ought to give some thought to how one is going to arrange things for the salt ships which are going to Portugal. Therefore, let me know at once what sort of expenses would arise if I should trans-ship salt\u2014 for example, I am expecting a Dutch ship from St Ubes, and if I should get it to run into one or other of the English harbours (the Downs would be best, or the river Thames) and transfer it to English ships, what sort of expenses would arise, so that I can make a few calculations? \nI remain &c.",

They write to me from Stockholm that the ships which are lying in Elsenap? will over-winter there as the wind has not helped them. So your iron prices should remain good. It has been freezing hard there for 4 or 5 days but if they had the sort of weather we have been having they should soon be in open-water again, and from the Sound they write that the winter is already past. I very much doubt that it will come to open war between Sweden and this country. We shall soon see which way things will turn. According to some, Brandenburg has come to an agreement with Sweden\u2014but time will soon tell.\n If all the 20 ships! have been chartered to go to St Ubes for salt there should be no lack of space for freight. Please let me know at once what freights have been agreed upon and whether the ships have been long gone. If you can learn the net number, within 2 or 3, lam anxious to know. Should it come to war between Sweden and this country it would be best that most goods should go to London though some proportion should come here even though with English ships. But what I do believe is that iron will keep its price for the moment, because it will be some while before one will be able to get iron at Stockholm. Through lack of sledge-trails this winter little iron will have been brought to the water-side, though I shall have further information within a fortnight. I trust that ours will have reached the coast, but from the principal mining-areas there will be little, for they must first make up their stores, if they can be obtained while the winter continues.

In view of what you say I shall expect to see soon the account of my iron as well as remittances, and if they have not fallen due yet please advance it at interest. I am astonished that you should say that that sort of iron is not in much demand in [England]. Please explain the reason to me, for it was well forged of good materials. I have contracted to deliver some consignments in the spring so if there is something which can be done with them in [England] I shall send an assortment of such kinds as you may be kind enough to inform me of.\n Regarding the drafts from France on [London] and from [London] on Hamburg or Amsterdam as mentioned in my letter of 4 November, I know that double provision and brokerage was promised, but against that it ought to be observed that from here to Hamburg and Amsterdam the course of exchange is usually 3, 4, 5 and 6 per cent higher than in the spring. We have found this over many years of dealing with one another, and if we then get them to purchase in France during the winter and then draw at 2 usances, as is customary, on Hamburg or Amsterdam, this way we can provide very speedy remittances from here. If it is done through [London] then the time is prolonged for 2 months and in the spring it is immediately remitted from here by the advantageous exchange, by which means the provision and brokerage are abundantly gained. Last year the course of exchange at short sight was 21 ML on Hamburg, payable in banco, and at 193 on Amsterdam, payable in cash. We have now drawn good sums at 224 ML on Hamburg and at 202 on Amsterdam. I am thinking of getting a quantity of miscellaneous goods bought in France this winter, for cash. If I decide to allow them to draw on [London] I shall inform you in good time who it is you are to collect their reimbursement from, and I firmly rely on you fora punctual performance. \n[P.S.] Please address the letter for me here to Mr Hendrick van Felde at Hamburg so they can quickly get to me at Amsterdam.

[hope too De Vliegende Wolff has now arrived safely, because the news from Hamburg must have been a mistake, for while they were reporting about the ship from Hamburg it was still lying at Marstrand. So I hope to hear by your next letter of its happy arrival and that its iron has sold at a good price, and when that is done, please close the current account and send it over.\n Regarding the amount of iron which the Guinea Company wants to contract for, I shall be fully content to deliver to them all the voyage iron which I can get made in a year in addition to anything I can obtain of other types. As you know from what I have told you, in future years I shall be able to deliver about 200 tons per annum of this sort, but this year it will not be so much, as not all my forges are suitable. If the Company will give \u00a3144 for what I can deliver this coming summer then I shall send it over at that price, but not for less\u2014to which I shall now await your answer. Meanwhile,\nGreetings &c. [P.S.] Capt Hendrick Matson will have to over-winter here, as you will have heard. I hope that you will not agree on the voyage iron for less than \u00a315 because I insist that I cannot count on such a quantity in the coming year, and that to all appearances there is none of that variety in stock. Please send me some pins by the first returning ships. And please also send two smooth, white, knitted woollen waistcoats.

As regards Hoegarden,* we shall have to wait for an answer to learn for what reason Burkin & Townley make difficulties about delivering the proceeds of the iron. The ships which are lying at Elsenap dare not depart as they have had news that capers are entering the Baltic with Brandenburg commissions. One has passed through the Sound. It should be declared that if he is captured he is likely to be treated as a pirate. They are now getting the Stockholm convoy ready to escort the ships through the Sound, but that will further delay their arrival so the iron which you have will, I hope, be sold before any new comes, and this delay will make the price rise. Iam intending to send some 3.000 slb of iron to [England] this year, if it can be conveniently done. Indeed, I may possibly send rather more if your iron prices are maintained. But, as against that, it may not be easy to get ships for [England] if the salt ships are going to be at Stockholm, which I presume are now lying ready to sail at St Ubes. Their number is not as great as you said it was, being only thirteen in all, whereof twelve are going to Stockholm and one to Gothenburg. The ships at Elsenap will not depart except with a convoy but we are negotiating with the Elector of Brandenburg today. People have also complained against the sale in Zeeland of six Swedish ships with Brandenburg commissions which does not sound too well here on the Exchange where the goods are bought. . . . [?]\n[P.S.] It would be a good thing to keep up the price of iron, if you see any opportunity for selling, because it will be late before anything of importance comes out of Sweden, even if everything turns out for the best.",

Van Racy and he, and no one else, may draw upon it. You will have also found that M. de la Bistrate is in agreement with me. Meanwhile M. Van Raey has been informed and says in his letter of 16 April:\n \u2018Tam sorry that you have to tell me that Widow Marescoc, in answer to your order to place the \u00a3700 draft to your account, does not want to accept it and says that she is not expecting any more drafts from me; also that she says she has written to M. de la Bistrate about it and can do nothing before she gets an answer from him.\u2019 He is disgusted with that, but I do not doubt that you have subsequently given him satisfaction as you promised. Doubtless wire manufactures will sell more readily soon, if that which has been lying here all winter and is now all shipped meets with no further hindrance. But as they cannot leave before we have found convoyers and are certain how things stand with Holland and Denmark, nothing will be going from here, and so far we have heard little of English shipping. I also consider that the consignments of \u201974 should be disposed of before you receive these of \u201975. I have decided to unload what I have lying here in 2 ships and to send it to Hamburg in order to gain time. I shall then urge M. de la Bistrate to do everything possible as diligently as he can to get it into your hands.\n As you say, the confusion in Mr Willem Momma\u2019s affairs is working to the disadvantage of the brass-trade and is quite unhelpful, but he will never again be as strong as he was. I have sold my iron to a reliable friend here and so I do not export it anymore, but I could do so for the copper bars ifthe Guinea Company will make up its mind. However, as it cannot be sent in that name or with any security for shipping this summer, unless in English ships, I shall have to arrange things so that either itis sold and paid for here or else my trustworthy friend in Hamburg will have to accept drafts against the credit of the bills of lading \u2014provided that I run no further risk once it is loaded free on board ship. And I should have to demand RD 60 for each Swedish shippound which would work out at about \u00a3 [blank], and then there is no need for \u00a7 per cent for advance of money, etc. I wait to hear what the Company will offer and remain, &c.",

You should by now have found opportunity to procure about 50 or 60 sacks of white scraped ginger at a reasonable price and I wait to hear news of your success. If you perform my commission for the yarn please do not buy the indigo, because all my credit balance will have gone, and as for the bale of Ardasse silk\u2014as I said in my earlier letter\u2014please sell it; because it will not perform any miracles here. You have urged me so much to make this purchase although knowing perfectly well that there was much of it in stock and more expected. I have been out of pocket for so long now that I shall be lucky to make any profit, so I expect you to put an end to the matter.\n Ihave ordered you to sell the whale-fins at \u00a3120: this I not only confirm but order you to dispose of them at \u00a3116, since there is no prospect of an improvement. As you know best, when one has bitten into a sour apple the sooner one gets rid of it the better! Ishall be glad to hear when the \u00a3100 on W.

Business is almost at a standstill. Everyone feels alarmed at the rupture of Brandenburg with Sweden and is reluctant to buy goods. Brown ginger can be had for 43g, and if it should fall to 16d in [London] one might be able to consider ordering some. If you are unable to effect the foregoing order for 2 bales of super-fine Angora, please buy in its place 2 bales of ordinary Begbesar, if it can be had for 3s 3-44, of the same quality as the bales Nos. 5 and 6 which you last provided and sent with Boys Ipsen. They were quite satisfactory. And as for any creditbalance which remains, please lay it out on Barbados indigo at 2s 4d\u2014though do not include the \u00a3100 which I remit herewith.

Indeed you have done well to make this agreement because I am confident that a substantial amount of that variety will be forged this winter. As regards the other condition, you can rest assured that I shall deliver just as good voyage iron as before and it will be others who will suffer the most loss for bringing my iron into disrepute. This year I shall deliver 200 tons and perhaps even more, including the consignment in the Coninck David, and I will certainly deliver the whole amount this year, but I cannot bind myself so precisely to the delivery-date\u2014namely, the end of August, especially because there is at present a general stoppage of all shipping. Ships are not allowed to depart, which is why the Coninck David is still lying here. I have about 200 tons lying ready at present, and when the quantity in the Coninck David arrives you can include it in the account for the contracted 100 tons. I shall load the rest in the first ship for [London] and for the future I propose that when I signify by bill of lading that I have loaded the iron in due time I shall have fulfilled my obligation because I cannot be answerable if ships are held up by embargoes, long detours or otherwise.

I hope it is also sought after in [England] and, awaiting to hear what is happening, I remain, with cordial regards, &c.\n[P.S.] Ido not know if you do much business in this linen, which has been lying around for so long, but if you could find a market for it I could send you considerable amounts yearly and employ the proceeds on goods from [England]. So little is happening at the moment that it is painful to think about buying goods, so we must patiently bear what pleases God Almighty. I remain, &c.",

If we can serve you further in this, just command us.\n We also find that the account of your drafts which we made concerning the Stockholm drafts were very badly done. At the time we had a great deal of correspondence, so it was checked in haste. Please forgive the error, and we thank you for pointing it out. In its place we are sending another, and please credit us for the \u00a35 flem. on your account. F) We thank you for the prices of sundry goods. With prices so very low we do not know how to make any profit, for nothing is selling here with all goods at rock-bottom prices. We wish we could be rid of our ginger and sugar without loss, for brown ginger sells at 45.g and Barbados sugar at 5 to 54g. There is nothing to be done with Ardasse and we still have our 2 bales lying here. Too many goods are coming from all countries and the war daily gets worse everywhere; one sees many fleeing people and goods coming in here, for the country is full of dread and no one here has any pleasure in taking any risks but is glad if they have nothing outstanding to lose. May the good Lord grant that we may be blessed and profitable! Our brother Cornelius returns Mr Davidson\u2019s! friendly greetings and is sorry that he has had so much trouble concerning the pieces of music he requested, but he is very glad that some of them have been promised to him by another friend. The outcome, and their despatch, will be very welcome to him.\n The exchange here also begins to fall, as you can see at the foot of this. With very cordial regards, &c.\n Pepper, 15 1/8g.

    "TEXT": "I wrote to you by the last post, in which I said that I would be expecting the protest for lack of acceptance of the \u00a350 bill of exchange, together with a draft for the amount and the expenses. This I confirm. Since then I have received yours of the 18th inst. together with the bill of lading for the bale of Ardasse and 2 bales of Turkish yarn loaded in Sybrant Clacsen\u2019s ship. May God bring him in safety. The account of the 2 bales of yarn, Nos. \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019, I shall check, and finding them correct will record my agreement and let you know. As for the whale-fins, I expect the account by your next letter so that I can see how much I shall have lost. I really believe the purchaser must be well-satisfied, for they were of good quality. Regarding the Swedish copper-wire of the brands you named, as far as I can learn there should be about 3.000 coils in town, and the said brands fetch 61 to 62 ML per 100 Ib, for cash. If any change should occur I shall not neglect to let you know. For freight charges from Liibeck one pays 3 to 34 ML per 300 |b., less or rather more, according to the total weight. What charges there are at Liibeck I shall write at once to find out and let you know in my next letter. Meanwhile, I believe they are inconsiderable though I cannot say how much more the route via Liibeck costs compared with that by sea. But it is certain that, of copperwares, copper-wire scldom comes here from Sweden by way of sea but rather by way of Liibeck and Wismar. It may be useful for you to know that Wismar is further from here than Litbeck and that people believe it will be besieged by the Elector of Brandenburg since he has totally routed the Swedish army, capturing much artillery and all its baggage.* In sum, the army is totally destroyed and, according to what they write, the general, some other great men and the French minister, the Duc de Vitri,? only narrowly escaped. This will change people\u2019s ideas: the suspicion which I mentioned before has vanished away, God be praised. If I can be of any service in expediting the purchase of wire or other goods, please just ask me to gratify your commands, assuring you that it will be done as advantageously as possible. Thank you for news of the prices of sundry goods. As regards sugar, I shall tell you in my next letter whether I am inclined to purchase any. I estimate that you should have about \u00a360 in hand if all my remittances are received together, which you will please employ on fine white scraped ginger. Please see to it that it is extra-fine. That which you last sent is plump and good but lacks lustre and it does not look white. Get if for me at the most advantageous price.\n The exchange on [London] continues to be high, so I have remitted nothing to you. I hope it will fall. Wherewith, cordial regards, &c.[P.S.] As the bill of exchange for \u00a350 was not accepted I expect the protest concerning it and a draft at short sight. A dio.",

Consequently our iron remains on shore, which we did not know about. It is lucky that we did not have it insured: our friends must have forgotten to inform us about it and, because of the rupture between that kingdom and this state, dare not write fully because of the penalties on Dutch property there. However, we wrote to Mr Uppendorff at Hamburg who informed us that you had a commission from our friends in Stockholm for chartering a ship or ships to go and fetch away the goods at Stockholm, and that consequently we must learn from you how things stand. If you can give us some further information concerning this please communicate with us and, because of the present conjuncture, arrange with our friends in Stockholm to take our iron in your own name and correspond with them as ifit were on your own account. From the bills of lading already sent to you you will be able to see what it amounts to, and when you receive our iron please do your utmost to procure its sale, as if it were your own. Furthermore, we thank you very much for your good and exact information about what has been happening to commodities. We could wish that times were better so that we could take pleasure in speculating profitably in something.

The Lord Hendrick Thuen-Rosenstr\u00e9m writes us to send with his enclosed letter the bill of lading for 42 slb of wire consigned to you, on which he says we may draw up to RD 2.200 which he has to furnish us with by the 12th and 19th of October. And he says we should correspond with you about what measures to take to ensure for him the cheapest remittances from [London] or drafts from here on [London]. Regarding this we shall wait to see your answer to know what we may do. The first convoy from Greenland has arrived here and in their company eleven ships bring with them 1274 whales, which is a good catch considering there are not more than eleven ships in the convoy. And in Hamburg the latest letters say that two ships have arrived which only had 5 whales cach, so many people conjecture that in general their catch is not large\u2014 time will tell. Meanwhile it is believed that in September, October and November the new train-oil will be available at f-273, and fins at f.38\u2014384. We remain, &c.",

    "TEXT": "My most recent letter was on the 21st. This one only serves to say that you should hold back from the goods I requested\u2014ginger, indigo, tobacco and galls\u2014and buy nothing until further order. And if by any chance you have already bought something and loaded it aboard some of our Hamburg ships please unload it again, covite que cotite. Even though one may have to pay the captain some conditional freight, I beg you not to load in Hamburg or Bremen ships since we have today received bad news from France that the King has declared war against us and given orders in all his ports that our ships are to be seized and confiscated wherever they may be found. We learned of this all too directly since a Bremen ship coming from [London] laden with goods was taken in the Elbe by a Dunkirk caper. Thank God Iam not involved, and may the Lord protect us from further attacks! Consequently I want you not to load anything you may have bought into Hamburg shipping. If by any chance you have bought the galls you can send them here in an English ship, but not any other goods. And in the bill of lading state that it is for your account and not for mine, which could be useful if it is intercepted. But, God knows, how easy it is to be innocently caught up in all-too painful losses! I have no doubt that you will help me, if it can be done without loss to yourself. Wherewith, regards, &c.\n[P.S.] If you have bought some tobacco and indigo do not send it here but keep it in London until further order.

For I am sure that all English shipping will now be fully employed and become the sole masters of the sea. If you could enquire about an English ship of 30 to 40 lasts, which you could charter to come here for a reasonable price and load train-oil to take from here to Rouen, it would not pay badly for I have worked it out that train-oil bought here at 30-31 ML per quarteel! (which is what it is costing at present) with all expenses, commission and freight at 17 crowns per last (of 10 quarteels) should cost 5455 \u00a3ton delivery at Rouen where, according to the latest letters, it could fetch 65-66 \u00a3t, which isa decent profit. And Iam sure you could procure the freight for \u00a7 French crowns per last of to quarteels (which are contained in 20 barrels) since you say that {s\u2014\u00a34 10s was being asked from [London] to Stockholm and back from there to [London], which is more than twice as far as from here to France. You have only to take up this venture, for which little capital is required, to make a decent profit. My brother at Amsterdam would take one-third and you two-thirds, for I would rather sit quietly and do without commission than trade without enthusiasm. If you decide to do something about it, hurry up, for winter draws near. At Rouen I use Mons. Anthoine van de Hulst, a good and zealous man who has served me well with this commodity. The voyage is a short one, the goods are not far from your country, so you have only to make up your mind and despatch a ship. Goods from [England] remain lying here at rock-bottom prices, so there is little enthusiasm for getting any more. If cotton prices fell somewhat lower, as well as Caribbean indigo, I might well decide on some. Pepper has been extremely under-sold at 14g and below, which is a poor price and gives no encouragement to order more, with which I remain, &c. \n[P.S.] Have you got a good friend to whom you will consign the cargo, or will you leave it to me? And if you are inclined to insure something there are good insurers to be found here at 4 per cent. ! While olive oil was sold by the 820 Ib. unit, train oil was sold by the quarteel of 448 Ib.",

J\u2019estime le sieur Le Page forta son aize. Il est icy en bonne reputation, luy ayant encor vendu 200 torches de la derniere partie receue par Hacker au mesme prix et conditions que la precedente, ainsy que je vous l\u2019ay advis\u00e9 par ma derniere. J\u2019estime aussy les autres ausquels le reste de la dite partie a est\u00e9 vendue tres bons. Sy desirez je vous repondray des debtes moyennant double provision, c\u2019est a dire 4 pour-centau lieu de 2, et vous feray bon le provenu un mois apprez l\u2019escheance des debtes soit qu\u2019elles soient receues ou non, surquoy seray attendant vostre reponce. Affin que les choses que nous arresterons demeurent constantes, tant pour ce quy est desja vendu que pour l'advenir, que sy ne desirez agreer cette proposition soyez assure que cela n\u2019empeschera pas que je n\u2019aye tousjours un soin particulier de ne faire mauvaise debtes et que je ne procure vos intherests comme sy l\u2019estoit pour moy mesme. Vous vous pleignez que le terme de 4 mois est un peu trop long: vous pouvez croire que sy javois peu obtenir plus court terme je l\u2019aurois fait mais je n\u2019ay pas creu quand on a affaire a des debiteurs qu\u2019on estime bons qu\u2019on doibve rompre un marche pour un mois de temps plus ou moins. On ne scauroit garder les marchandises en magazin qu'un mois ou deux se treuve insensiblement escoul\u00e9 et quand il se presente marchand il faut encor accorder autant de temps pour le payement comme ona demande au commencement. Le principal est de prendre garde aux debiteurs quy soient d\u2019entiere satisfaction. Je m\u2019informeray de la diference qu\u2019en fait icy entre les marques de la tulippe, de | marque, de la [ 2|M, et de!\u2019 N pour vous l\u2019adviser s\u2019il ce peut encore au pied de cette. Les chaudrons de cuivre jaune ont est\u00e9 icy autre fois bonne marchandises, mais sont a present fort demeurez et ne se vend que a des chaudronniers dont la plus part sont tres mauvais payeurs, ainsy je ne serois vous conseiller de n\u2019envoyer de grande parties, seullement un thonneau ou deux pour essay, et sy vous y voyez de profit allons on pourra continuer d\u2019en envoyer plus grande parties. Je vous ay dit que les droits de romaine pour l\u2019entr\u00e9e sont \u00a35t du cent pesant; les autres frais sont comme sur toute autre choses, pour le frait, portages, visitation, droits du poix, courtages ct scullage, que vous pouvez a peu pres calculer sur les comptes de fil de latton, dont je voy que desirez encore m\u2019envoyer 300 torches, scavoir 200 torches de la mesme sorte de celuy que m\u2019avez envoye et 100 torches de la mesme marque mais beaucoup plus gros. Cette derniere sorte ne sera pas bien propre icy, ainsy sy\u2019] n\u2019est charg\u00e9 advant la reception de la presente j\u2019estime que ferez bien de n\u2019en point envoyer plus de 50 torches pour un essay, mais ne pouvez manquer d\u2019en envoyer de l\u2019autre sorte ou en treuvera bien le debit. La marque de la tulippe n\u2019est pas estimee icy. Ce sera pour garder longtemps ee Celle de la marque \u2014\u2014se vendroit mieux; on l\u2019estime 40s pour cent moins que N, mais les trois couronnes de Laurens de Gier sont icy en estime pardessus toutes les autres marques, selon quoy pouvez vous regler. Je ne croy pas que cette marchandise soit pour baisser de prix sytost a cause de l\u2019hiver et de la guerre contre ceux de Hamborgh a moins qu\u2019il n\u2019en vienne de trop grande parties de chez vous a la fois. C\u2019est a quoy vous debvez prendre garde et sur cela prendre vos mesures. Je seroy ravy de vous pouvoir proposer quelques choses au negosse ou il y aye apparence de profit et d\u2019y prendre part avecq vous, mais la guerre m\u2019a sy fort rebutte que je n\u2019oze rien entreprendre. Sy je remarque cy apprez qu'il y aye quelque chose a faire je vous le proposeray vollontiers. Je voy le subit rabais des changes pour France. Cela a est\u00e9 contre le sentiment de plusieurs et m\u2019a empesch\u00e9 en partie de vous remettre le reste de vostre advance sur l\u2019esperance de mieux faire comme il c\u2019est fait icy ce jourdhuy au dessus de 563d et que selon les apparences cela ne peut continuer longtemps; sy me croyez il me semble qu\u2019il seroit micux de remettre pour Paris a 2 ou 3 usances, moyennant 4 pour-cent pour mois rencontrant de bonne lettres ou le bailler sur la place a intherest pour 6 mois a raison de 5 ou 6 pour-cent pour an, sclon que l'occasion se rencontrera, surquoy seray attendant vostre advis. Je voy le peril qu\u2019il y a en la proposition que je vous ay faitte. Je ne croy pas qu\u2019on y tienne sy fort la rigueur y ayant assez de personnes quy ne font pas tant de difficulte mais toutes personnes ne me sont pas propres. Ce sont choses desquelles la fidelit\u00e9 et le secret sont fort requises, quy ne sont a confier que a des gens qu\u2019on cognoist parfaittement bien. Je feray reflection sur ce que m\u2019escrivez et vous diray mon sentiment par le prochain. Je vous remercie de l\u2019advis du prix de l\u2019indigo. J\u2019en ay icy 18 caissons que je souhaitte chez vous; je ne scay sy on ne pourroit pas les y envoyer par navires anglois.

My brother, H[ermann] Olmius, tells me that two small ships have already been chartered at Wells! to bring grain to me here on your joint account. May the Lord bring them safely. I hope they are still over there at the moment as the weather has been very terrible on our coasts with these daily north-west winds.\n Grains are just as quiet as they were before, especially barley, of which the best that comes from England is selling at \u00a323 flem. Rye is at 136, 140 and 145 [gold guilders], wheat at 155 to 160 and 170 [gold guilders], malt at \u00a318\u2014\u00a321 flem., but ifexports from England come to an end in February, as people tell me, grains will undoubtedly rise for Brabant promises to double its demand, and so it would not be unwise to store up what is coming from you. Iam extremely grateful for the kindness you have demonstrated in wanting to continue our correspondence through a profitable business. On my side I shall keep you informed whenever I spot anything profitable. Barbados sugar is very scarce and since the bad news from Barbados no one who has any will sell it, and the manufactured sugars have been sold before they are ready so it must rise considerably, in my judgement. The last were sold at 52g but now there is no price quoted.\n The exchange on France has risen to 1034, with all the signs of rising higher, and it has been pointed out to me that with the exchange from [London] on Paris at 543d, to give that price there and send the bills to be negotiated here and send you returns at 365 8-0\u00a2 (as it is today) is a way of earning a rather nice interest.\n If there is anything in which I can serve you or your friends, freely command, yours &c.",

I hope the Lord will bless you with mutual happiness and allow you to live long together to salvation, in all the prosperity you could wish for. Meanwhile, because the business is now in your hands, we shall continue our correspondence. I wish we had the opportunity to make it rather larger but things are in such a bad way here that nowhere is there anything to be done. Thank you for informing me of the prices of goods. I have carefully considered each one but could not find anything likely to be profitable. Indeed, several commodities which you mention and which must necessarily come from [England] have been sold here at a loss. May the Lord soon give us better times and a general peace and then trade, which is disrupted in nearly all parts of Europe, should revive again. People are expecting that the ambassadors ofall the countries involved will soon be meeting for peace negotiations at Nimwegen. May God grant that this long-wished-for work may proceed so that in the coming year (in which I wish you all success and prosperity, as above) we may be cheered by news of peace.\n The two kind letters of your wife, of the 24th of September and 1st of October, reached me in due course. I am glad to see that you sent the sample dishes to Rouen. Mons. Schockfeuer writes me that they were safely received and I must thank you for taking such trouble with them. It is also good to see that you obtained acceptance of the \u00a380 drawn on Caspar Kaus\u2014payment will undoubtedly follow. For the \u00a357 11s which Mr Brodridge has drawn on I have credited your account.\n Ihave just assigned on you a small bill of \u00a33 3s payable to Mr John Elwill of Exeter, being the balance due on an account. Please pay it on presentation and place it to my account, forgiving the pettiness of it.\n Now, concerning trade\u2014as you say, thanks to the conjuncture of war England has become the general warehouse and has nothing to complain about. Here, on the contrary, little or nothing is happening, nearly all commodities being at very poor prices and little or no demand for them. Regarding prices, I refer you to the enclosed price-current.1 Corn has been very high in price here and for some time large amounts have been coming from England. Something might well be done with that. I understand it has fallen in price at the moment but, even so, it fetches good prices, vizt.:\nEnglish wheat fetches from 168 to 178 gel. rye from 130 to 140 ggl. per last, according barley from 95 to 100 ggl. > to quality, each gold malt from 94 to 98 gel. guilder is 28 stuivers. oats from 54 to 58 gel. buckwheat from \u00a324 to \u00a330 flem. rape-seed from \u00a336 to \u00a342 flem. > per last. linseed from \u00a329 to \u00a331 flem.\nIt is rumoured here that the King may abolish the customs or duty which is given on its export from England, or perhaps prohibit its export altogether. If that were done it would cause a striking increase in price here. But otherwise I can see little signs of any change in the immediate future, and large amounts would have to come from England before it caused any decline\u2014for your information.\n So, if I can be of any service to you, you have only to command me, and with cordial regards I commend you and Madame, your wife, to the protection of God, and remain, &c.",

    "TEXT": "I last wrote to you on the roth inst. I have since received, last Saturday, your three letters of the 26th and 30th of November and 3rd of this month. By these I have seen your commission to buy 600 coils of Swedish 5-band brass-wire for 62 ML at the most, of which I have made a note. But I am sorry to say that there is nothing to be done, as you will have seen quickly enough! from my previous letter, for the price of wire is rising daily here and now no Swedish wire can be had for less than 66 ML. This type is nearly all in the hands of one man who is maintaining the price as he pleases, and the stock which he has is believed to be not much more than 1.000 coils. None can come from Sweden for the next year, and elsewhere not much will be worked for lack of money and credit. One should be able to obtain Hamburg wire at 66 ML, but I fear it will rise higher.\n From Rouen has just arrived, fully-loaded, Thomas Frost sailing Hendrick Weever\u2019s ship called De Perell, in which I do not dare to load anything although I suppose it is as safe as if it were built in England. He last came here with it from [London] and is now, as I understand, chartered by a friend but before that will take in some wire for Rouen\u2014I mean, for [London]. There have been some English ships in lading here which, for a fortnight, have not dared to take in anything except from Englishmen. But others have taken in goods for anyone, and they are not especially obliged to go to other places, so on that point there is no difficulty\u2014for your information. The Holstein ships are also passing freely. One from Tonningen was brought in to Fryck[?] but by orders of the King was freed and his costs repaid. People also have great hopes that our ships will again be allowed to sail freely. Philip Muncker, in whom your wire is loaded, is completely ready and only waits for a good wind. His ship is a galliot and has no other name. May God help him arrive in safety. Enclosed herewith is going the account of the 150 coils of wire loaded aboard him, amounting to \u00a3382 9s 2d, for which I debit you. Please check it, and if you find you agree with it make a record of it. To all appearances you should do well with it. Besides Muncker there are two other small ships laden for Rouen, which are also lying in the Elbe because of contrary winds. Altogether I think these three ships are carrying away about 4.000 coils and nothing of other copper wares such as sheet-copper or brass, etc, as far as I can learn. To know the exact details one must spend something on the customs lads, which I shall do and then inform you in my next. If you continue to want reports about this please let me know so that it can be arranged.\n The friend who has about 1.000 coils has told me that he had decided to send them to Bordeaux, and then another 200 coils of the \u2018Lily\u2019 brand, which can still be had for 65 ML, and to receive them without regard to the quality. For as soon as our manufacturers discover that so little Swedish wire remains they will push up the price of their other brands. These types [of wire] have been usually paid for immediately, and it could well be impossible\u2014 especially in these times of rising prices\u2014to stipulate payment by waiting for remittances from London. And even if prices were not rising one would have to pay more if one sought to defer it. So, if you want this commission to be performed, please enlarge your price-limit and also give me permission to load in Thomas Frost, who will be ready in a few days. At the present there is no other alternative. If I had performed the commission already I would have drawn on you for my outlay, as your ordered, and consigned it to you as instructed. The weather here is still mild, without any cold but plenty of rain and storm. The bill of lading for the 103 sacks of ginger has been received and will be useful. I hope the purchase of 10 sacks of cotton at 53d has also gone ahead because, since they have been bought outright, the buyer ought to keep them. And I would judge that the hurricane in Barbados can make little difference because, apart from this lot, nothing much from there has arrived for a long time. If one can still get such good quality for 54d I would be content to go shares with you in 30 sacks for which I think the price is so low that one can hardly go wrong with them. If you are favourably disposed towards the idea please obtain such a quantity and send it here, on the understanding that not more than ro sacks are bought for me. If you think it advisable you can delay this purchase until the ships expected from Smyrna arrive. It sells here for 13g and 133g in lots of 1 or 2 bales. Our ships from Spain have not yet arrived but are expected every hour. With regards, &c.\n [P.S.] Thank you for the news about the hurricane. Asa result, Barbados sugar and ginger are selling rather better and if it continues it will cause further changes.",

And I hope we shall have abundant opportunities to cultivate our correspondence, for which we need an early peace. If you could contrive to get the Guinea Company to buy from you 2.000 to 3.000 pieces of Marglitzer as well as other sorts of the cloth which the English buy in Germany, we could establish an important business together. I am eager to know if one can do anything with \u2018aurum\u2019 pigment in [England] and whether a decent amount could be disposed of ? Sugar remains at a low price here, although people will talk about a hurricane in Barbados, but this news has already come too often and there is a good quantity of sugar chests here. There is also such a quantity of blue indigo that it is likely to fall to 4g. Our ships will bring a substantial amount of indigo from Spain; all silks are lying unsold and very cheap, and the silk-weavers cannot recover their debts outstanding in Sweden and Denmark. I understand that good quality Smyrna cotton is available at 54d, and I would buy a parcel of it if the Marglitzer linen were sold, so I ask you to do your duty about this. If we allowed such a current commodity as linen to lie unsold for such a long time we would lose all our commissions. We have to sell what arrives from Germany as quickly as possible and make returns in cash or goods, so we have to accept most of the goods on our own account and pay for them. If you grasped this maxim you would dispose of more goods, so please give some thought to it immediately. I shall not be able to dispose of any great quantity of sugar, cotton, ginger, indigo, oil or galls for you this year, remaining, with friendly regards, &c.",

Concerning the Marglitzer linen\u2014you are incorrectly informed that Banques! has contracted to deliver it to the Guinea Company in England. It is true that there are three or four Englishmen here such as the two Townleys and others that buy it and send it to England and Iam sure that Banques has a share in it, but the idea that any monopoly should arise from that is odious and accursed of God. No one could imagine that a monopolist has emerged, particularly when everyone over here is so anxious lest the Company should bind itself to buy from only one person. Mine could only be sold for a 10 per cent loss at 15s, and for some time it has been selling at 18s. If you could obtain a price of 1751 might at last decide to strike a bargain\u2014or I could sell it here for delivery to England, for there is a demand. Iam eager to hear further news about how things are going with Barbados goods and, if you think I should keep or sell some Barbados goods which I have bought, I beg you to participate. Brown ginger can be had for 43g so it can hardly be brought from [England]. Smyrna cotton is definitely not to be despatched (though other sorts could be) otherwise I might have contemplated having a good quantity from you. Pepper is at 133 g and I am sure it will soon be at 134g. To sum up, goods are so plentiful here that sales cannot make any impression on them.

    "TEXT": "In due course I received yours of the 18th of May, 8th of September and 8th past, from which I have learned what is happening with Swedish goods in [England] for which I thank you. I would have answered your letters before now and sent a quantity of brass to [London] if I had not encountered numerous obstacles due to the outbreak of war, but I have been hindered from doing so and until recently I have been unable to obtain a complete disposition of my goods. And since the season is now well advanced I shall have to wait until the spring before I shall be able to ship anything. Meanwhile, I sce that the prices of brass as well as of iron are very bad in [England]. However, there is very little brass being sent from here so whatever is being sent to [England] must be from old stocks that have been lying at Hamburg and worked up there. It looks as if very little brass-ware will be made here this winter, partly because of the poor prices abroad and partly because they will be short of calamine. Consequently, these wares ought to be able to fetch a better price in the coming year if not too much is worked up at Aachen and Hamburg.\n However, the price of iron in [London] seems unlikely to improve for the present as the greatest proportion of our exports has to be shipped to England, and the ships which have been held up nearly all year are about to arrive with substantial amounts of iron\u2014bringing more than can be consumed in a whole year. For some weeks the price here has been standing at about 24 to 25 copper dollars, excluding expenses, but seems likely to fall lower. Garcopper is at 217 to 218 dollars per shippound, and \u2018Crown\u2019 copper-wire will cost about 573 to 58 RD per shippound on board a free ship with all expenses paid (each RD being worth 5 copper dollars). Pitch isat RD 40 and tar at RD 20 to 21 per last, free on board, though it cannot be shipped from here except through the Tar Company, and someone called John Strother\" has contracted with them for everything which goes to England. St Ubes salt is at 164 to 17 dollars per ton.\n The war is making business very bad here and people see very little prospect of peace, which we pray God may grant. But I understand that there are negotiations for the freeing of trade between this kingdom and Holland and if they succeed it must soon be made public. If there should be any changes in the price of brass-ware I beg you to let me know, and also tell me how much the pieces of eight called \u2018pillar\u2019? are bought for in London and whether they are allowed to be exported.\n If there is anything here I can serve you in, please ask freely.

First we must thank you warmly for your New Year wishes and likewise wish you all good fortune and prosperity.\n Regarding your proposal that you join with us and our brother David to contract for all the copper-wire that is presently being made in Sweden up to the month of November next: although you are of the opinion that a good profit could be made for the various reasons which you allege, we think that while it is true that little copper-wire is being made in Sweden and that this country and Hamburg have few stocks of this commodity and there is also little of it in London or Rouen, nevertheless they are beginning to make copper-wire in Aachen and in Hamburg itself and are likely to continue doing so as long as it will sell well. Furthermore, as long as this ruinous war continues consumption will never be as great as it was and therefore we sce no future prospect of any great rise in prices and (for that reason) the market for it will be postponed. Above all, we are faring so badly with the Reenstiernas and Momma that we have no more desire to make any contracts with them, so there is not the slightest chance of one being made. Also we would not dare to trust our goods in Sweden, particularly as the treaty of commerce between that Crown and this state has not been ratified because of some hitches. We are also not keen to engage in any other business as long as the war continues.\n Meanwhile we are grateful to you for your kindness in offering to involve us in this and other undertakings, and likewise for your news of the price of various commodities. Swedish copper-wire is selling here for about f-64 per 100 Ib. The prices of other wares you can see from the enclosed price-current,* to which we refer. Mr William Wathing has asked us to draw for him f-150 (that is to say, one hundred and fifty gulden) but as Madame, your wife, has ordered us not to pay him more than f.40 or f.50 and as he has previously told us that he has no need of money we have not dared to do so without your further order. Your bill of exchange on Messrs Bartolotti & Rihel is returned herewith, accepted, and we remain, with cordial regards, &c.",

    "TEXT": "About the \u2018O\u2019 and \u2018G\u2019 iron, your reasoning is very good and I can well understand your argument, but since the prices of iron are at present so low it would turn out to be rather too expensive, and as your iron is now selling for less than it costs in Stockholm it is my opinion that very much less will be shipped this ycar, particularly as the commercial treaty between Sweden and this state is likely to come into effect. We shall learn the outcome in a few days. The estates of Holland are assembling within six days and if it goes ahead there are plenty of salt ships here ready to depart, and as a result there will be no need to have anything to do with English ships. As the salt ships can go nowhere but here with their return cargoes freight rates will fall and as prices are much better here the iron will also be shipped hither. However, you must meanwhile continue to organize your sales as you have so far and as you find most convenient, only give some thought to what I have said above. As soon as we have the outcome of the treaty of commerce I shall let you know in case there is anything worth thinking about with regard to salt. About 30 ships from St Ubes are expected here any day and there are about 60 lying here in lading, several of which, if trade is freed, will set off for Stockholm in June for f-64 to .63 per last, so there is no need to have anything to do with English ships. However, if one could charter one for \u00a36 or \u00a36 $s then one might risk sending it to St Ubes and then on to Stockholm. If you can acquire such a one! would be content for you to charter it for us provided that it sets sail at the earliest opportunity and so can arrive in time to join this fleet. Meanwhile, please find out if there is anything of value over there which could be freighted for Portugal and Stockholm. There is someone [in London] who has obtained six or seven ship-loads of salt for delivery in Stockholm at a fixed price and who has given orders to charter ships here\u2014indeed, if he can obtain the right price he will buy salt here and send it on to Stockholm. Iam expecting six or seven ships in the first fleet to arrive, but whether they will be going on to the Baltic I cannot say yet. If you were inclined to take a one-fourth or one-third share in one or two, assuming that I can arrange for them to go there, I would give you preference before others. I seldom take others as partners but between us it could be arranged. Iam also considering chartering one or two for St Ubes\u2014Stockholm\u2014Amsterdam, and if you want to participate please let me know. I would guess that the ships which are now being chartered will be leaving about the sth or roth of April, and they could be in the Baltic by September or October, provided that there is a convoy at St Ubes. I estimate freight at about f-64 to f.65 per English last, and f.3 or f-4 more if they are not to wait for the convoy, but one must be careful to state in one\u2019s orders for the Sound whether the voyage is to Stockholm, Reval or Riga. Reval lasts cost f.2 or f-3 more; Stockholm and Riga lasts are the same as here. As for the insurance, find out how it should be arranged over there and let me know\u2014 with my thanks for informing me.\n I shall write about the pan-iron and see that they reckon up the numbers better. Iam delighted that the suit with Mr Townley has now been settled. Ihave heard nothing more from the Baltic, and from Italy the news is rather conflicting, though all speak of a hard and skilful fight by the French, and no ships taken, though some speak of one and others of two left behind. People are also talking of a second battle, or the beginning of one, but there is as much guess-work as certainty about the business, so we must wait for another post\u2014wherewith I remain, &c.",

You know when I was in London I discoursed you about the trade of Zantand told you what my cosin Houblons had lately done that way which doubtless will turne to their great advantage this yeare, therefore to lay the better foundation for the next season I have wrote as I promised you I would both to Mr Thomas Cordell of Zant, who was recomended me for a very honest man as also to Signor Gio. Druyvestein of Venice, my old correspondent. Last post I received Mr Cordell\u2019s answer at large which I send you here inclosed that you may see his discourse. In a post or 2 I expect Signor Druyvesteyn\u2019s answer at large which shall lett you see also and then wee may consider before winter whither he doe anything or no. Probably I may be in London about midsomer or presently after so may have time enough to discourse it.

It would be a good thing to achieve, if only one could insist on the performance of what is promised and agreed, for in order to do it one must be absolutely sure that, in the event of one drawing any bills, neither we nor our friends in Hamburg or Amsterdam would run the sort of risk which has befallen us formerly and which has happened to Rosenstr6m over the wire which was loaded in [Capt.] Kool\u2014i.c., the bills of exchange which he drew against it have been left unpaid in Amsterdam. In such a casc it is better to promise nothing so that one relics on nothing, than to allow matters to turn out adversely. It greatly weakens credit, which in these times and especially in these parts is quite tight enough already. You can understand that better than we can explain it.\n If you would be satisfied with these conditions\u2014vizt. to advance us \u00a33 15s or \u00a34 sterling on cach shippound of wire as soon as the bill of lading is despatched, and then the remaining \u00a312 10s or \u00a3137 as soon as we have news that the shipload of wire has passed the Sound, we will be able to deliver into your hands all the wire which Cronstrom and Rosenstrom produce (with the exception of those factories which are now little worked) provided tnat you make known these conditions to all those friends in Hamburg or Holland on whom we shall have to draw.

I had only heard about it last week from Mr Urban Hall who came to visit me here, because your letters\u2014which would have informed me\u2014have not yet come to hand, and consequently I have not been able to discharge my obligation to wish you happiness together. This will therefore serve principally to wish you all good fortune, praying the Lord God to bless you and grant you many years of joy and prosperity together.\n Ihave noted with pleasure the safe arrival of Captain Goldstone and I have no doubt that the Company! has taken the iron at the same price as before, as was intended, according to your previous letter, for it is not my fault that the iron has arrived rather late. I expect to hear by the first post whether you have agreed with the Company to deliver my voyage iron this summer for the price of \u00a314 5s, as you wrote in your last so that I can organize myself accordingly. For unless that is done I doubt whether I can arrange things so advantageously since little iron has been forged here this winter and large amounts have been bought up for pretty high prices.\n With regard to the proceeds of your salt, I have written to you at length that it would be to your best advantage if I settled it against your current account, because the iron was dearly bought and it was not advisable to store the salt since it could not be sold for so high a price in the spring. Iam now being offered a ship-load of salt by English merchants for 15 dollars per ton and I see that you are thinking of consigning me another quantity of salt in the new year. If you do so I shall dispose of it to your best advantage.\n Regarding the bill of exchange on Johan Fahlgreen: it is not yet paid. I have sent your letter to him, and I do not doubt that payment will soon follow as I have had news from Westras,? where the money is to delivered, that it is daily expected there, so I hope your letter of attorney will be unnecessary. Johan Trotzig has not yet paid up and I can get no answer from him, though I have been told by his brother-in-law in Stockholm that he would pay shortly. In future you would do well not to extend such credit, as you can be sure of a heap of trouble anda long wait. I have sent the RD 100 bill of exchange on Johan Staelhaus to Stockholm for acceptance and will give you news of it by my next. I see that Captain Guttery has arrived at Gothenburg and I have written there to know how things stand with the goods. It is dreadful that the posts are so unreliable and that we are mutually lacking so many letters. I cannot tell what remittances you have made for me to Mr Van de Mortel and, since the 2oth of August, I have received no letters from him. However, I hope you have withheld the proceeds of the iron in the last two ships in order to offset the proceeds of your salt and the sum of the bills of exchange which, I think, altogether should just about balance each other. I have advised you before this that Mr Perman has given orders to Mr David Leyel [in London] to pay you the \u00a3150 relating to Jacob Fahlgreen;> and with regard to your claims on Willem Momma I have not until now (with the power of attorney) received the necessary information, but as the goods have been sold to Mr Perman (as I wrote to you before) there is nothing which can be done now. Also, Momma says that he is no longer in debt to you, as you perfectly well know. You would do well to obtain your claims on him amicably, like a sensible chap.*\n Because the money in your account has now been offset there is nothing to be said about the purchase of brass, but if you send a consignment of salt in the spring please write fully to order what you want done with the proceeds.

But it seems to have been overlooked that that is all right as long as they are chartered by Englishmen; but if they are chartered by others who are also friends of Denmark, how are they going to manage? If they lade in English ships they are going to need other certificates, and in my opinion that is not very advantageous for the English ships and not many are going to be chartered by foreigners. However, as some people were of a different opinion a few have recently passed the Sound which were loaded here, so everything is continuing on the old basis.!\n Ihave written to Sweden to inform them along the lines which you advised and all the iron which has been kept back will be shipped for your account. I shall sell it solely to you and you can be the guarantor or insurer against all risks and take it over on its arrival in return for a gain of 14 per cent.\n Winter is now ending over there and they will soon have open waters. There are also about 300 slb of pan iron lying at Stockholm which I would send to you with the first available English ships if any were lying there and if the freight charges were reasonably cheap. But at the moment there are still about 600 slb of ordinary iron over and above that, which I must consider first. Furthermore, I have given orders for improvements in the future manufacture of pan iron so that the bars are more even, for they seem not to have been turning out smooth. I have no doubt that those which are coming will be entirely satisfactory.\n As I have to pay rather a lot of Swedish bills of exchange during the month of May I now have to ask you if can draw on you \u00a3500 at two or three usances. I would be greatly obliged if you could accommodate me. And please let me know at once how much premium is at present being demanded [for insurance] from Stockholm to London and to Amsterdam in English shipping.\n At present there is little news. Il est vray qu'il es fort difficile de dire qui aura l\u2019avantage, neanmoin je suis persuad\u00e9 par les predictions qu'on m\u2019en fait tenir qu\u2019elle tomberont du coste de la france et qu\u2019avant le mois de Novemb. nous pouvions bien voir grand Changemt. et qui sait si ce ne sera pas en Septemb. qu\u2019au temp on ne se peut pas tant arreter mais avec le temp le tout reussira pour le bien de l\u2019eglise de Dieu nonobstant qu\u2019on ne fait que cultiver tout le contraire et que des Grande miseres la doivent preseder.\n The letters from France speak of a heavy incursion of the French into the Waalloon country against the defences there which are all in fire and flame.\u201d The soldiers are suffering great misery in a place where they have been repulsed by a Dutch regiment which lay there, but it was hard fought and according to another letter which has since arrived three regiments (two Dutch and one Spanish) have fallen, and it is said that 12.000 to 15.000 men are dead. \nI remain, &c.",

Further, you have been pleased to share with me in that, as well as the two following letters, the news of what is happening in trade at [London] for which I am obliged but I must confess to you that current market prices here are so restricted that it is impossible to gain anything by sending things here, unless one has some other advantage (which is unknown to me) or has the good luck of a favourable change in prices while the goods are on the way. For the last nine months we have done nothing in Swedish trade because no Dutch ships have been able to sail there, and this year will be still worse because the King of Denmark is beginning to detain English ships and to check whether they carry Swedish goods. People have been talking for a long while about a treaty of commerce between the Swedish crown and this state and saying that Dutch ships going there will be allowed to pass the Sound unmolested, but we have seen little result from all this and not much reliance is to be placed upon it.\n Finally, I must thank you most humbly for your kind offer, whereof shall take advantage if opportunity occurs, and in return offer my unworthy person to share in the honour of your commissions: you can assure yourself of good and punctual service.

At last he offered 64s, at which price I sold them to him. I could scarcely bring myself to agree, seeing that the price is miserable and does not leave much above 9 per cent profit, but your urging to sell at the earliest opportunity and the fact that others are selling moved me to do so. And in my opinion I did well, for various people have it for sale and much more is expected. We would have done better if ours had arrived earlier, for a friend of mine has had 22 casks which he received with an earlier captain and he sold them at 62s. There is also news from England that another ship from the Bermudas is expected this year which will bring a good quantity and I believe this must be the reason why good quality stuffis already being offered today at 6s which puts that which was bought for 63[d] in London ina bad position. I wish you had not also bought this last lot, though if it is thoroughly good we must see if it cannot be sold perhaps for a rather higher price. Among those which I sold were various rolls which were so rotten and completely dry that they could be crumbled into powder, and the purchaser consequently claimed a 30 |b. deduction. How far we should agree with him let me know in your next. As soon as the captain completes his loading the account will be sent with him. If the campeachy wood which I asked for has not yet been bought please forget it for I fear that much has arrived with the galleons in Spain and it may perhaps fall lower in price. If the fleet from Virginia has arrived I would be favourably inclined to go halves with you ina trial quantity of Virginian leaf. If you decide to do so, please buy 6.000 to 8.000 Ib. for our account at a price of about 43d, making quite sure that it is good quality and undamaged. You must also see that it is bought advantageously at the best time, for unless one makes an advantageous purchase there is no chance of making a profit these days.

This is in answer to your undated letter, though from the account accompanying it I find it to be of the 13th of January. Iam now still lacking your letters of the 3rd of September, and of the \u201816th instant\u2019, which I think must mean December. I have safely received the account of the wire sold from [captains] Marten Olofsen, Roelof Anders and John Wilmot, together amounting to RD 1.720. Ihave checked it and recorded it, but am extremely astonished that you allowed the wire to lie around when you could have made between \u00a36 3s and \u00a36 5s for it yet did not sell a single coil for eight months. Now you are selling it for the scandalous price of \u00a35 16sto \u00a35 18s, and that for 4, 5 or 6 months time! I had much rather that you had left it lying, because in these difficult times it cannot be delivered and the ships which left here last autumn did not have very much aboard. This year even less will come as very little was manufactured\u2014about 25.000 coils less per annum than are made in time of peace, for your information.\n You have also not sent me any account of what was sold between October 1674 and January 1675, being about 2.000 coils, which I shall await, as well as the account of the coils sold in Rouen which you have not sent me. I expect the loss to be settled, for the longer one delays the worse it is, and I am surprised that the insurers of the Caritas lay claim to the full insurance. It is quite true that they ran the risks while the ship was lying in the Daalders and were liable, and also for the risks of going to London when, because of the war, the goods might have been lost. [am not liable to pay for the insurance to London, and I ask for nothing more than what is just and fair. You can judge it impartially yourself. You say, regarding the said goods, that you have sent a power of attorney because someone has assured you that Hiebenaer is making some claim on them. Whoever wrote that to you has deceived you with lies and it is quite unnecessary for you to meddle with it and send powers of attorney, for I myself shall answer for it here. Regarding the latten, black kettles and basins, please make an end of them and do not haggle about the price. I was influenced by the advice I got from [England] on April 11th, 1671, when someone else stated that 400 shippounds of black or yellow kettles could be disposed of every year, and perhaps even more, but I see now that one cannot rely on such advice.\n Tam also not a little surprised that you remind me to take care that I reimburse you for your outlay, yet I have not received any account and do not know what your claims are.

    "TEXT": "Sir, I find myself with your letters of the 16th of November, 22nd of December, 13th of January and sth of February, with information about what has been happening with regard to Swedish trade, for which I thank you.\n Your considered opinion concerning copper-wire I judge to be well-founded, and by buying it up you will make your intentions clear and be able to control the market according to your desires. But as for your proposition that all the copper-wire which may be made up to November next year should be placed in one person\u2019s hands and not be allowed to cost more than \u00a35\u2014\u00a35 5s in London, there is not the slightest prospect of it for the simple reason that the creditors of the \u2018Three Crowns\u2019 and \u2018Crowned N\u2019 works have to contribute payments to help the works get going, and as a result the owners are not free to dispose of the brass which is produced at their works. Secondly, all the brass which has been made here for the last year has cost not less than 245 to 250 dollars per shippound, because the high price of copper has been supported by the launching of the copper coinage, and it could not cost less than \u00a35 145 in London, with all expenses included, even ifit could be bought here for 250 dollars. Indeed, that price has been offered in vain and it looks as if it will rise higher still as soon as the ships come to be loaded because little has been produced \u2014the \u2018Three Crowns\u2019 works having been at a standstill for a whole year, and the \u2018Crowned N\u2019 works going slow and at a standstill for the last two months. For the last fifteen months I have had about 470 slb from the \u2018Three Crowns\u2019 works lying at Norrk\u00e9ping which I was prevented from exporting by last year\u2019s troubles. It consists of about 313 slb of copper-wire, so slb of latten, 50 slb of black kettles, 30 slb of \u2018English\u2019 kettles, 10 slb of \u2018Scottish\u2019 pans and 5 slb of pots. Mine was part of a consignment which should have gone to London but which cannot be sent now as I understand there is a restrictive order in force requiring one to declare that the goods loaded in English ships are for English accounts. It is good of you to offer to take on all the risks and to reclaim the goods as if they were your own, being consigned in your name, in return fora reasonable consideration, but you have not stated how much and these wares can only bear a little. Ifit could be done for 1 per cent above the ordinary insurance rate I might well agree to it; at 2 per cent there are plenty here who could do it but I would find that too much. If you would charge only 13 per cent on top of the sales-commission and order my brothers at Amsterdam to arrange the insurance and manage the expenses so as to avoid the deduction which London insurers make in case of loss* I shall be interested to hear your opinion and await your decision at the earliest opportunity. If by any chance some shipping-space should turn up and permit the despatch of some goods on these conditions the insurance should be calculated on the basis of \u00a3134 sterling per shippound and the sale made in as short a time as possible so that no bad debts can arise.\n Notwithstanding the fact that iron is fetching little abroad the price here is being maintained at 24 and 25 dollars per shippound.\n I wish you and Madame Marescoe all happiness and prosperity in your marriage, with heartiest greetings, &c, I remain, &c.",

I also proposed in my last letter that you should take a cargo of brass in your own name and at your own risk, but this also cannot be proceeded with as the English ships will load no goods unless they are shipped by Englishmen or unless they have a certificate from the English Envoy that they are for an English account. So I sce no means of shipping them to England, but will negotiate with an Englishman to buy them on condition that they are consigned to you and bought from him on delivery in London. Please do not place any charges on the goods which will be sent you by him on my recommendation.\n English ships are arriving here daily and when the ratification of the commercial treaty comes from Holland, as is expected every hour, there will be plenty of Dutch ships also so that freight-rates will be cheaper than last year.\n There is a shortage of water here so that many works are at a standstill and as a result the price of iron remains at 24 to 25 dollars.

I do not believe I shall be sending much iron on my own account this year as it can be sold here at good prices. Furthermore, the English merchants here will no longer allow any Swedish property to pass under their names, and the poor prices in [England] rob one of any desire to send any. The [Royal African] Company ought to take the consignment in the Coninck David at the previous price, as was agreed, for the fact that the iron arrived rather late was not my fault. As a result I have not much desire any more to contract with them.\n From the accompanying letter you can see what Mr Perman has written to me about the \u00a3150. Regarding Antony Pingar, I have found out that there is little or nothing good to say since he has married a woman of ill repute.

I have since received your welcome letter of the 1oth of April, from which I more fully understand your discourse about the free passage of ships and what arrangements you have organized and, above all, that I should speak with our friends here about bringing all the wire into your hands to prevent undercutting. And since your competitors have now all been bought out and all the wire is only in your hands the price has risen to \u00a36 ssand could well be held at \u00a36 tos, and before the end of the year you will have no difficulty in getting \u00a37\u2014which makes it all the more surprising to me that you have not been able to sell my wire for more than \u00a36 and have left if lying for eight months and have been selling it quite disgracefully although you knew that this change could be achieved and in spite of my warnings that it could well have been kept another two or three months! Lalso find that I have no relevant answer to my letters, for in those of September 1675 (which you have received) I wrote about the account of the wire sold by you at Rouen and making good the loss, but to that I have had no answer and there still remains due to me the account of more than 2.000 coils which were sold in 1674. I shall expect both accounts so that Ican see how to organize myself. You crave only that all these goods should come into your hands but do not consider the risks which the owners would have to run, for even if one had them fully insured it would still be unsafe because one cannot be certain nowadays that bills of exchange! would arrive on time. If you want to get all the wire into your hands you must do it differently and send a servant here who can acquire it and also pay out the money and declare them to be English goods. Otherwise all this writing is in vain, as I have said to you before.\n There are now a good many ships from England arriving at Stockholm, but I doubt that they will make any great profit, selling salt at 11 to 12 dollars per ton, and even if they gain handsomely on the incoming cargoes I suspect they will have to sit still and wait for the outgoing ones, for they cannot load their ships with anything but tar, pitch and iron, of which there is plenty and which will be so abundant in England that it will be unsaleable. But not as much wire will be coming as is wanted because little is being manufactured here, and without some unforeseen events there is likely to be a lack of calamine and clay which this country does not produce and without which the works cannot go on.

I wish you both all the contentment this wourld affords, with long life and ctarnall happinesse in the wourld to come. Your letters came to my hands but the 11th present by which I understood of your sending me 3.000 pieces of eight and your order to receive the fifth part of the fraight the Providence hath made from England, and to send you returnes by the same ship if possible. As yet none of the money come up but expect it in 3 or four daies. They will sell for the best cambio any pieces of eight hath sold for these ma[n]y years. I not knowing of your sending of any before the ships arrived hath hindered me from providing returnes, which now is impossible being no goods in towne, nor hath their bin any gaules this yeare bought for reason being exceeding scarce, though have made a shift to gitt 300 sacks against the Providence arrived that shee might not loose any time. They are for account of Sir John Lethicullier, Mr Burkin and Mr Torriano and were sent for Scanderoon before the ship arrived. The Company haveing made an Order that all unfreemen that traid a broake of 20 per cent (on what goods soever are sent from hence) should be paid, soe that I presumed it might have altered your intention of sending downe any money. It remaincing behind will be no prejudeice to you, for we expect no ships here tell our Generall Ships arrive, and in 3 months will be new gaules and silke, which are alwaies procured at first very cheipe, and I hope by that time to understand your being free of our Turky Company. It lies not in my power to culler your goods in my name, the whole factory being sworne to give in a true entry to our consul of what goods we send, though not for money we receive. Your ship Providence may be ready to depart in 20 daies, your 100 sacks of gaules being not laden will be no prejudeice to her for shee will make an extraordinary fraight to Legorne, thrice as much as the voyadge before. The Assistance and Dartmouth frigatts may depart in company with her as alsoe the Martin. 1am sorry to let you losse soe brave a convayance but cannot be helped. As I act in your concernes shall advise you. I would send you a sortment for cloth but its to late for next ships nor should we give you any great incurradgement to send any but ready money, pieces of eight or lyon dollars from Holland with which can procure what goods you desire and send quick returnes, which is all at present, we remaine Sir, your most faithfull and obliged servant, T.L.",

I hope that things will soon improve and go better in the autumn\u2014time will tell. Business otherwise is still miserable here and I see that the price of goods is still falling in England. Ardasse silk can be had at 9s for the best. When I bought mine I thought it was at the lowest price and could not fall lower but it seems that one can never rely on that. Commodities are arriving in too great abundance and consumption is small. May the Lord grant some improvement. Last Friday we had a fierce fire here which laid 25 to 26 houses in ashes. The damage is estimated at over RD 300.000\u2014may the Lord comfort the losers. God be praised, I am not among those involved.\n With friendly regards, &c.\n[P.S.] On closing this I received your letter of the 28th of July, to which there is little to be said. I see that the [East India] Company has decided to sell its goods on the sth of September when one thing or another ought to be quite cheap, but for myself I cannot decide to encumber myself with further goods, for however cheaply one buys there is always something cheaper around. It is best to sit quietly for a while, hoping that these bad times will at last change and get better.

    "TEXT": "On the 4th of June I wrote letters to you by way of Stockholm and on the same date by way of Gothenburg, which I hope have come to your hands and to which I refer. I have since received, by way of Gothenburg, your welcome letter of June 16th in which there is much that requires an answer.\n Ihave grasped what you relate at length about the sale of the 1.720 coils of wire which you included as sold in three accounts of 1675 (in September, October and November) and on the sth and 13th of January 1676, but I have plenty of reason to complain about it for since the 15th of January 1675 you have scarcely written to me about what has been sold except to say, in the account dated 13 January 1676, that since 15 January 1675 (when I last had news) my copper-wire has remained lying unsold while others have been selling at \u00a36 and \u00a36 2s for 2 months time, at \u00a36 4s and \u00a36 3s for 4 months time, and \u00a36 ss at 6 months time. And according to your recent letter of June it has continued selling since then at \u00a36 4s and 5s and \u00a36 3s and \u00a36. I can hardly accept your excuse that there were such large amounts of wire from others and that theirs was preferred before mine, for in several letters you have said that most of it has been bought up, that very little was out of your hands and that you soon expected to have your \u2018turn\u2019 and intended to sell at higher prices. Take a look at your letters from the beginning of 1675 up to June\u2014I have had little news since then that it has been my \u2018turn\u2019! It is as if you had no wire of mine in your hands. And now I have unexpectedly got the account of the 1.720 coils sold as above, so you must not find it strange that I complain excessively. I shall not clear your account of the debt but make a note that you have administered such an amount. And as for the wire which was sold in 1674, you say the account was sent at the proper time but I cannot find it in any of your letters, much less find any mention of it. Now I have got the copy of three accounts, but in none of the three is the time stated from which you have credited my account. In the one concerning 900 coils I have nothing to say except that you have made an error of 7s 3d in the parcel sold to Elizabeth Packer on the 27th of November\u2014in place of the \u00a3158 1s 11d which you put it ought to be \u00a3158 9s 2d. In the other account, of 700 coils, I find the weight is rather less than it ought to be and the time for some parcels should be altered from 1 month to 6 or 7 weeks. But the third account, of 870 coils, I cannot find acceptable at all, since you state them to have been sold without putting any date or time, and also without naming any person but simply \u2018to sundry\u2019\u2014which is nota style that ought to be used. And, above all, these 870 coils are over 10 centner short of their weight\u2014which you will please have checked and then give me some pertinent explanation.\n I have now also received the account of the 360 coils of wire sold in Rouen, and in that it is stated that you have to make good \u00a37.728t 7s 11d for the proceeds and that you have made good to me alone \u00a37.575\u00a2 tos 6d. How that comes about you will know best, and about the compensation for the damage on the ship Samson (where there is also 7 centner short on the weight of the kettles) there is nothing mentioned\u2014which is all taking too long. lintend to do nothing about Townley\u2019s claim, for it is an unjustifiable claim, as all upright and impartial persons can judge. It is the same with the insurance on the Caritas, on which the insurers will hand over no more than the premium, while the insurers in Holland in a similar case raised no questions.\n The reason why you have had the RD 2.000 bill of exchange returned is\u2014you say\u2014 because you have little or nothing for me on account, alleging further that there is a bad debt owing by someone called Harrison for goods sold in the time of your partnership with Mr Joye. But I find that that item was made good to me over four years ago in my current account and as no mention of it was ever made it does not convince me. It is no wonder that you have nothing for me if you handle things in such a manner! I quite understand that it is not permitted to export earth! on pain of death\u2014one cannot afford to run such a risk. It is abundant in our area around Aachen and also in the Li\u00e9ge country and in France but the war prevents us from being able to get any here. People have been saying for a long while that the trade treaty with Holland would be concluded, ratified and exchanged, but since then it has remained quiet. Meanwhile the English alone have the trade of Stockholm, though I believe it will be of little profit for they dispose of their goods at Stockholm reasonably cheaply and on their return cargoes (and especially iron) they will lose a great deal. They behave in the way you described\u2014as soon as they have acquired their cargoes they are forced to sell in order to pay for the freight and expenses, but it is not for someone like me to object\u2014one must know how to make a profit until this squall is over, for like the last I do not think it will endure for long and as soon as the shipping returns I believe things will go for me as they did before. I can send nothing as long as these wars last, nor would I advise you to send anything to my son unless you also send a servant who could declare them to be English goods. I remain, herewith, yours &c.",

    "BILL": "\u00a3151 175 3d to Stephen Boarcroft\u2019s order in London.",
    "TEXT": "Larrived back here about two days ago, and before my departure from Middelburg yours of the rst instant came safely to my hands together with an account of the iron received from Willem Mynart,! with which I have recorded my agreement.\n I was not happy to see that a quantity of \u2018OO\u2019 iron has come to London despite the fact that I was afraid it might arrive by mistake. My nephew, Trip, bought a quantity at Stockholm for delivery here, as was agreed, but later it slipped his memory so that when he heard that iron was much dearer in Stockholm than here he gave orders for it to be sold, forgetting to write that it was not to go London, and that is how the mistake occurred. I would have gladly remedied it, but it was too late. You can judge if the people will make anything with it, having paid 263 to 27 dollars per shippound in Stockholm. Before my departure from Middelburg I wrote to tell you to insure the iron in the Zebulon, captain Joseph Pyll,\u201d for \u00a31.000 sterling which I trust has been completed. The said captain had rather severe weather in the Baltic and lost his mast and came to the roadstead off Danzig to refit, according to my nephew Trip there who left from Stockholm in his company. I hope he has now got fine weather so that we can soon expect him. Boor writes to me that he sent the letter containing the bill of lading by way of Gothenburg so it may soon arrive here or reach you. There was also some pan-iron expected which would also be sent to you with the first available ship. No other iron will be sent to you for the present, so what you have should hold its price. Iron is scarce in Sweden and all that has appeared is now being shipped here.\n We are trying to do something about getting the posts going and have sent orders to the Resident Lemere? to speak with the King of Denmark about it, but he could not comprehend why it was not taken too well here, knowing that one can drive no trade without letters. We have decided that if Denmark does not show any understanding we shall pay them no subsidies until the posts are going freely again, and I believe the Danes will soon change their minds.\n I have today received letters from Stockholm dated 14/24 August which mention that Captain Pyll lay ready to depart, so if nephew Trip had not written that he had come to Danzig I would assume that it must be another ship\u2014unless there are more captains with the same name.\n Herewith goes the bill of lading, which is the fifth. The others have to date not yet arrived. Some more iron will be loaded with the first available ship. Isuppose it will not inconvenience you ifI drew against this cargo while the present rate of exchange is rather high, for cash is quite scarce now that the ships from Sweden are about to arrive.\n By the next I shall write to the Lord Douglas in case he comes to speak with you. Please tell him that I have today drawn on you \u00a3651 17s 3daccording to the details below,* which are recommended to your care:\n\u00a3200 to Ab. Gerard\u2019s order; \u00a3,100 atauenee: to Jacob van Ghesel\u2019s order; \u00a3150 to Seger Corselis\u2019s order; \u00a3151 175 3d to Stephen Boarcroft\u2019s order in London.\nConcerning the wine cargo which I mentioned before, I shall now only say briefly\u2014that the freight must cost no more than $s or 10s more (or less) than others; that one must look for a captain who is known to be an enterprising seaman, a man who can judge a situation well; the ship must not be too big and its bills of lading must be correct for the Baltic. Let the insurers take care of the cargo, worth s5.000-6,o00 ft. I suppose the premium from here will be 9 or 10 per cent, or rather less. Lacam at Bordeaux is good. There is little good wine to be sent from here, but from France nonetheless the expenses are just as large. I shall enlarge on all this by my next. If you think it is a good idea give such orders as you think fit. I cannot tell whether it will turn out well, without any mishap. If the ship is rather bigger load it also with such new goods as are in demand from there, but make sure they are good things which are loaded. My time has run out so I must break off until the next post. Meanwhile, I remain, &c.",

    "TEXT": "I last wrote to you about three days ago. Since then I have received yours of the 8th instant, from which I have seen that Smyrna cotton is not to be had below 5$d and that consequently there was nothing that could be done about my commission. So one must be patient and let it rest for the moment, I have recorded my agreement with your account of the indigo and likewise with that for two bales of Ardasse, so there is nothing to say arising from these. Your cask of Jamaican indigo has turned out well, which its purchasers cannot deny, but they will not agree to give a higher price for it. However, I shall do my best with it and if there is anything to report I will let you know.\n William Cutler has arrived here, God be praised! I shall now procure the receipt of the two bales of silk and try to sell them as soon as possible to our maximum advantage. I see you have no great inclination to sell it for time, but it may not be possible to avoid and if I decide to do so I shall stand surety for you, not doubting that you will allow me 1 per cent for it, for it is customary here for people to deduct 4 per cent for selling and standing surety for Italian silks. However, to encourage our relationship I shall answer to you for 24 per cent. The campeachy wood went for ML 7 8s, which isa poor price. A friend of mine received a quantity with Cutler\u2019s ship which cost him ros in [London], so I hope yours will not cost more, otherwise I could not support you. Swedish garcopper can be bought for RD 58 and is selling in Rouen for 74\u00a3t which does not leave much margin in my opinion, so I may not perform your commission. The expenses here are about the same as on the wire, so you can best work it out. Of Swedish wire there is none to be had and, as I said in my previous letter, there is also none arriving at Liibeck. If it was here it could be fetching 68 ML and Hamburg wire fetches 70 ML per centner, so in that commission there is also nothing to be done. About 250-300 coils of Hamburg wire have been shipped to Bordeaux. For Rouen I have not been able to learn quickly what has been shipped. The expenses on wire, here and at Liibeck, are about 73 ML, not counting the freight from Sweden to Liibeck, per shippound of 320 lb. Most of it is brought by way of Litbeck\u2014it seldom comes directly, for your information. A great quantity of iron has arrived at Liibeck which may weaken the market rather, but of copper and wire people think little will come out of Sweden this year because of the large duty and the unfreedom of their ships.\n If my 4 barrels of blue-dye are still unsold, please look after them, for one hopes this commodity will rise in price because henceforth only a limited quantity will be made. If you have achieved anything for me with regard to the [East India] Company I expect to hear. Please buy another 4 cases of indigo guatemalo at 2s 8d or below and, ifit is possible, pour out some so that you are not deceived, or otherwise check one barrel thoroughly to see if it is a high-quality blue. If it is fine, without anything false or mixed with powder, please take it and inform me ofit. Your draft of RD 50 in specie will be promptly paid and debited to you. Concerning the information about the position of Sirps, Iam grateful to you. A friend here has also had letters from him, but the letters in which he gave orders for his reimbursement failed him. However, he does not doubt that he will give him complete satisfaction, wherewith cordial regards, &c.\n[P.S.] Regarding what I said above, at least 1.000 coils of wire are going to Rouen with a Holstein ship provided with a French pass, but according to letters received today from Amsterdam the same ship has been seized at Dunkirk.

At Norrk\u00e9ping this year there has been absolutely no shipping-space available for any destination and because of the dispute between the Crown and Queen Christina over the customs duty no goods have been able to come here from Norrk\u00e9ping. I have been waiting in vain for some opportunity to ship out something. There is now going there a small English ship called the John & Edward, captain John Stabler, from Bridlington, which is chartered for the account of Francis Townley and going from there to the river Thames where it will receive orders from Townley whether it is to travel to Rouen or unload at London. But lam quite sure that it will sail off before you can load any goods in her. There is a quantity of brass loaded in the said ship, ordered by Mr John Greene, who wants it insured in [London], and on my recommendation it is addressed to you. Please serve him to the best of your ability. You will receive orders from him about the amount of the premium to recover from my brothers in Amsterdam.\n I understand that another English ship, with salt, is expected shortly at Norrk6ping.

It is a troublesome business that one can hardly succeed in loading anything, If it were not so late in the year I would make up my mind about getting a small vessel to come from England, and I would have done so already if I had not been given hope that the dispute over the customs duty would have been settled by now.\n The coarse cloths called \u2018dozens\u2019 have been selling at a good profit this year, likewise the calicoes, such as bleached \u2018moorees\u2019, \u2018hummums\u2019 and \u2018addaties\u2019 and all kinds of French haberdashery.?\n Because of the quantity of copper coins which have been minted, silver and gold have risen so one might easily make 10 or 12 per cent on pieces of eight or silver ware.

Pray God send tham a good voyadge. The Providence will doe well, and I hope will incurradge you to send her againe. You picces of cight remaine yet undisposed of. What received for other friends have changed at 11 per cent. I doe not question, giveing a little time, but to sell yours for 143, soe that returnes being omitted sending by these convayances will rather be your advantadge then otherwise, for all goods will be plentifull and cheep now the ships are out of port, and I hope your next will informe me of your being free of the Turky Company and that my brother Samuel will have the honour of your comands at Constantinople, and from thence as goods are sold the money remitted hence or to Smirna as finding incurradgement, which often turnes better to account than sending of pieces of eight or lyondollers. By the last ships my selfe and partner received 8 large bags of cocheneile from Cadiz which have disposed of at LD 1s per oake against Ardasse silke which will be under 6 LD per Rotolo, no bad account the charges on cocheneile being but small. Few daies since arrived some Borma Legee which was bought at LD 10 per Rotolo. There is good quantity of more to follow which hope will be bought cheepe. I know not anything more worth your notice at present, I remaine, &c.",

Your 3.000 pieces of eight sent by Mr Skynner & Co. of Legorn have advised you in my former letters to have received, but have not received any goods soe presume were not laden according to your order. If you had sent cocheneile would have made you a good account, for when the Providence arrived was in demand and could have sold a larger quantity than we had at above price, though at present its fallen under 12 LD per oake occasioned by the French who have had some and expect a great deale more soe will goe off but slowly for the futer. Your 3.000 picces of eight have disposed of, the cambio comes to LD 13 to 12 percent, there arriveing quantity, or else had got you 143; at present worth 9 per cent. Few daies since arrived some new gaules; its reported to be plenty this year soe if find them cheepe shall invest your money in said comodity, and shall ly ready for the first good convayance provided you are free of the Company or else shall not send them, for the Company are so strickt that they will make you pay 20 per cent, they haveing made new orders of late, that with out breach of oath cannot be cullered by a factor, being sworne to give a true entry to the Company Treasurer here.

    "TEXT": "Your letter of the 29th past has come to me safely, from which I see what you have to say about the request I made, in offering my son to be taken into your counting-house. I must confess that I did not know the conditions which prevail in England as well as I now understand them from you. Things are arranged quite differently here. It is true that in some cases money is given by those who are widows, who wish to continue living with their sons. For they have little knowledge of places abroad and are unwilling to send their children away, and since they are people of means they are quite happy to give a sum of money so that they can be accommodated and keep their children at home. Some are taken on for nothing \u2014or, at least, without money\u2014as we did with our servant Claes Bene who, as we know, corresponds with you about the purchase of his goods. For six years he served us for nothing, and for the other two years that he was with us we gave him RD 100 per annum. Meanwhile, I see that you are very willing to take my son and prefer him before others who have been offered to you if I will engage him for seven years, give surety for his honesty in the sum of \u00a32.000 sterling and pay \u00a3300 sterling for seven years. Regarding the first two points I could well consent, namely that he should serve seven years and I could give security of \u00a32.000 for fidelity for of that lam entirely confident. But to pay \u00a3300 sterling in addition I think is rather too much, seeing that there is no trade and very little going on, so that our lives are very constricted. When some improvement is expected I would be very willing to give \u00a3200 flem. or RD 500 in order to have my son in your firm, but since you say you have offered to do his pleasure for the former condition of \u00a3300 sterling but not for \u00a3200 flem. or RD 500 I must thank you for your kindness. In passing I have since discovered that, while young men in [England] do give money, there are other conditions which you did not mention\u2014that those who have served out their apprenticeship and carried themselves well and want to remain with the firm can enjoy a half-share of the commissions and several other conditions, which you know better than I do. It means that they can soon earn back the money they have paid for their service. What you decide about this I hope to learn in due course. With very friendly regards, I remain, &c.",

We thank you for all your trouble but, as we have often said, we can see nothing profitable among the one or the other, for there is no demand and the exchange rate on [London] remains high. Prices are being much undercut here by the English, as well as others, so if one wants to invest one\u2019s money one can do it here more advantageously than in [England]. We still have the last 265 sacks of ginger which we bought, lying here unsold with other lots, and are negotiating to buy another 400 sacks here which we are being offered at 4g per Ib. with 83 per cent discount. Among them are many sacks of white ginger and we are offering 33g on the above conditions. Whether we can obtain them for that a few days will reveal. As for what else trade has to offer, pepper is going very cheaply in Holland. We are expecting a quantity for ourselves. Campeachy wood is cheap and we have been considering speculating in it for some time but cannotas yet make up our minds. It fetches only 73 ML per 100 lb and the old was 83. Grains are continuing to sell, such as rye at RD $7 to $8 and fine wheat at RD 61 to 62 per last. The wheat is likely to be cheaper than the rye in future. Insurance on English ships has jumped because with every post one hears of them being intercepted and held, and the Germans will hesitate to be as liberal about lading in them as they have been. To sum up, things are daily getting worse for trade, and we must have patience and wait for the amendment of our lives. With friendliest regards, we remain, &c.",

    "TEXT": "In answer to yours of the 13th instant, I am grateful that you will be of assistance to the Lord G[ ?  ] on his arrival. In a similar case I would be likewise at your service. I further see that you have not been able to achieve anything in the purchase of tobacco, since nothing good was obtainable below 6d. It is true that I see no prospect of it falling here for the moment, but I do not think it would be advisable to spend more than sd per Ib. for there would be nothing we could do with it when the expected ships arrive in [London] and good quality stuff is obtainable at sd. I refer you to my foregoing letter. You report campeachy wood at 10s, at which price there is nothing to be done, I find. However, Iam told that it is being sold for 9s in [London] so if you could buy it at that price, free on board, and will take a half share, I would gladly take the other half of 25.000 Ib. on trust. It sells here for f.63 per 100 lb., but with such a quantity one might have to settle for f.63. English copperas fetches f.6; to f-63 per 100 Ib. and I would be glad to learn what it costs in [London], for there seems to be something to be done with that as well. Thank you for news of ships arriving in [London] as well as of what is happening in trade. Little is happening here. Bermuda tobacco comes here seldom and at present there is none in town. If any should come it would not fetch above 4 or 5 stuivers per lb. Brazil tobacco in varieties are from 9 to 10 stuivers per Ib. to 124.and 13 stuivers for the best. Indigo guatemalo is at 28 to 30 stuivers per Ib., Pernambuco wood at f.34 per 100 Ib. Roman alum 47s per 100 lb and English 33s. Cochineal is mostly at 303s per Ib. Aleppo galls are f.34 per 100 lb., Smyrna ditto, f273. Senegalese gum is at [blank], White Brazilian sugar, 10 to rxg per Ib., and muscovadoes 84 to 82g per lb.; Barbados sugar 63 to 63g per lb. and Nevis 62 to 7g per lb. Lead is 24s [per 100 lb.], tin f.45 [per 100 lb.]. Brown ginger f.114 per 100 Ib.; white ditto f-13. Apulian oil \u00a357 lem. per tun; Seville ditto, \u00a356; Port Oporto and Lisbon \u00a353 to \u00a355. Zante currants f.16 per 100 Ib. Milanese rice 47s per 100 Ib. Cardamon 444 stuivers per |b.; cubebs 8} stuivers. Ardasse silk, 16 to 163s per Ib. Because of the great differences in Turkish yarn therc is little I can say about them. Ordinary Angora is at 34 to 5s per lb.; better sorts at 6 to 10s per Ib., and the best from 12, 13 to 155 per Ib. Begbesar from [hole], Camel hair is in reasonable demand here. Aleppo fetches from [hole] to 33 and 34 stuivers per lb.; Smyrna from 28 to 29 and 30 stuivers. Smyrna cottons are 10 to 123g per lb.; Cyprus cottons 12 to 13g per lb.; Barbados yellow [cotton] 15 to 163g and white ditto 14 to 154g per lb. The best nutmegs now sell for 55 stuivers per Ib.; poorer quality fetch 50 stuivers; cloves are 804 stuivers and mace 163 to 18s per lb.; cinnamon from [hole] to 60 and 70 stuivers. Madder, f-25 to 26; unprocessed ditto from f.18 to f:19. Cut whalebones are f-45, iron pots f.73 and copper kettles f.624 per 100 Ib. The best Danzig steel in small barrels now fetches only f.113 per 100 Ib. Since I sent you the notice of our [East India] Company prices other wares are selling as in the enclosed notice and in Zeeland they began their sale yesterday. The English draperies trade is absolutely at rock-bottom here since there is no demand for the goods and they are selling at very low prices. The smallest white pack-cloths of 28 yards length have been sold for from \u00a311 to \u00a311 flem.* per piece, according to quality, and I notice that white northern kerseys are now reasonably current, fetching from f.18 to f.22 per piece. Mixed grey kerseys are from f.20 to f-22 per piece, for your guidance. If you see any service I can do for you, you have only to command, wherewith I remain, &c.",

You had also by the same convayance soo barrs rusty iron, and assoone the remaynder of the proceed of the goods comes in it shall be also made you home in the same manner, which is the best way of returns as the times now are. Hambro wax when cheape bought in may sell here to advantage and although the proffit be but moderate its a stable comoditye and goes of to good men. I thanck the recommendation (of the ship of corne intended hither) to mee. I have this yeare had 8 or ro thousand bushells of that comodity which sold at losse, it coming after the fayre. Many shipps arriving therewith before and a promiseing harvest approaching lowered the pryse above 30 per cent although whats good sells now somewhat better. This is no market for that corne but that for 2 years past was a scarcity in Castill made it here extreame deare, but licence beeing granted for its coming freely from France brought a supply. However, if yours bee good it may sell for about 8s sterling per hanegas, whereof 2 bushells inglish make one, and 6 per cent losse more. In Ireland I am informed its verry cheape. If you have any friends there which are concerned this way pray afford mee your recommendation to them. From thence are brought hither quantities of tanned hyds, salmon and hake. The wyre, unlesse I can meet an occasion to putt it off according to your order, shall remayne. For the other part of the letters good advyse and kind inclination I render you my dew acknowledgments but I am sorry to finde my selfe without the other part of your good opinion. I will assure you, I so much esteeme the honour of your service that weare there any designe I would incourage you to ingage in with such successe that I might appeare without shame I should be always at yours, but as trade now goes I am almost afrayde to mention almost any comodity haveing soe often miscarryed in my expectation, and for Sir John I will affirme and desire you to believe mee, that I never discovered but his prosecuting this trade is more for my advantage then his own intrest, always ordering mee to incourage any friend to what I can and he will send what they will not, whereby you may be sensible you are in your thoughts under a misteke. I know you are able to send one hither fitter for the imployment but not more cordiele to you, nor can I see how another will now as the times goe bring to passe what I have donne. It was my shallow experience made mee singly undertake what I did, but I thanck God I am now securely planted for those difficultyes I formerly encountred and [if] in any thing I may be serviceable to you, you will assuredly find mee in all sincerity and affection as well your faithfull as obliged servant.\nSir John hath consigned mee 11 bales calicos wherein you are $ concerned and 18 bales wherein you are $ which God sending safe I shall take care to remain and in forme you in dew time of there sale.",

    "TEXT": "My last letter was on the [blank]. Since then I have received yours of the roth instant. Our people in Sweden have no need to sell our iron without orders. What came last year was due to a misunderstanding, as I explained to you.\n As for the 1.500 slb, it is neither \u201cO\u2019 nor \u201cG\u2019 iron. My brother Emanuel, who also has works in Sweden, always sells his iron in Stockholm. It may well be that your friend has bought some of that iron, but I believe he will have paid dearly enough for it. It is an iron which always come here as a rule. It is also an Orgronts iron, but he will first have to make people familiar with it. The smiths always mark it \u2018Oo and there is none in England. Everything that was made last year came wholly here, and next year\u2019s production has not yet been sold. He is accustumed to sell all his iron to one man in one place, and this year nephew Trip has had it. He makes about 6.000 to 7.000 slb per annum, so this 1.500 slb must be old stuff. If the purchaser is wise he will have that iron sent here. It would yield him more than the 19s [per cwt.] in London for it is familiar here.\n About the time that the ships were coming out of the Sound they passed the Nachtegael which had been forced by contrary winds to run into Norway. Since Mr Lacam? cannot achieve anything about chartering a ship we shall have to let it lic. It would not have been a bad voyage, arriving before the winter, but in the spring it would not be advisable for there will be quite enough provided from here.\n I trust the price of wine will change considerably for it is low here but rising, and is doing so in Sweden, so I believe the English will not be fetching so much in the coming year. Those who were there with salt ships this year will lose their appetites for going again, and because Dutch ships now have free passage there will be no English ships which can sail there at that price. One can freight from here to St Ubes to Stockholm and back again for less than f-52 per last of 18 tuns, if delivery is at Stockholm. I would judge that freight-rates at Stockholm will be low next summer and one can already reasonably foresee that the price of salt will not be very high.\n About this commodity, I have been speculating that because it is forbidden in Portugal to come to St Ubes in ballast there are few ships here which want to go there, and if that remains the case while winter comes on I might find that not many ships have been chartered to go there, and then it might be worthwhile chartering one or two English ships, if they can be got for less than \u00a36 sterling, in view of the fact that with few English ships coming to Stockholm freight rates at London may be quite cheap. I shall thus be glad to learn from you at what price one should be able to obtain them. If one could succeed in getting them for \u00a35 it would be tolerable, even allowing for the fact that because of the high rate of exchange the money would be worth more and amount to at least f.57. But the return freight would be paid for in heavy moncy and another advantage to set against it is that, with the English sailing without convoy, they should be able to get to Stockholm rather carlier if the Dutch ships are not called for in time.\n Tam not at all of the opinion that the English will want to go to St Ubes at that price, but they might be willing to when the winter is nearly over, and to take away their fear of lying waiting a long time we could stipulate two months for the total loading time at St Ubes and Stockholm. If the ship going to St Ubes is clear to load up we must write to my correspondent, N. Simons, who can ensure that he is loaded within 14 days. The freight-rate between here and St Ubes is less than f.28. I shall now wait to hear from you at approximately what price it can be expected to be [in England] for my guidance in case the St Ubes flect has departed from here.\n If you have any inclination to have a Dutch ship fetch a load of salt and go to Stockholm, please let me know. Iam thinking of chartering one for myself. Please be quick. I shall leave it to you to inform me; otherwise I shall keep it to myself for time does not allow one to wait for an answer.\n The answer about the premium on the Coninck David will have to be awaited at leisure, but please tell them to hurry up the business. I do not think that I ought to bear the interest whilst the consignment is not credited to me. It is due to you, but it must be found from that item for I have already paid for it here and so far I have had nothing out of it but trouble. I long to know what the item will yield.\n If the business of Townley is not settled yet, please let me know. I shall then write to Mr T. so that he can persuade those good people to make an end of it. My correspondent at Lisbon is Nicholas Simons, consul of His Majesty [the King] of Sweden. I am sure it will be more advantageous for him to draw bills on us here than on London, though I do not know what the exchange rate on London is. You should be able to calculate what the rate was on drafts in the spring. For the English salt ships the exchange on us here was at 61g [per cruzado].\n The insurance rate here on Stockholm is 10 per cent. Our ships, which are due to come from Stockholm, are taking rather longer than I had expected so I am running a little short. Thus I trust you will permit me to draw \u00a3500 \u2014{\u00a3600 on you against drafts falling due. If the effects of mine which you have do not cover it when it falls due I shall make it up some other way.\n Please let Negrinus? have another \u00a320 and help him sort things out so that he can be certain of getting his papers over before the spring.\n The letters from Denmark have arrived but bring no further news with them. The Swedish army draws further offand those at Hamburg write for certain that Malmo has been relieved and that the Danes are afraid that Sweden might well enter Bleking and besiege Carelstadt. , .\nWherewith I remain, &c. [P.S.| I have today revoked a bill of exchange for \u00a3100 from Exeter so it must not be accepted. I beg you to guarantee that amount and send the bill and the protest to Isaac van Hoegarden at Limerick so he can put things in order. Ifacceptance is lacking the holder of the bill will speak to you.",

Woalls for some goods (as barre tinne from the west country at \u00a33 10s per cwt. abord) may be taken to advantage, also pepper, bays and sempiterns, good and cheap, will buy the best woolls.

First, Sir, | begg your acceptance of my harty congratulation of your happy marriage (the which have been advised from England) wishing you all imaginable joy and prosperity. Secondly, beleiving you are become a natural subject of the King of England (knowing it was your intentions so to be) I hope that all things desired and designed thereby may be effected to your full content, and under the protection of so noble a prince may you see many happy days.\n Sir, I call to mind now your most obligeing promise to honour me with your comands ifat any time you thought of trading to this place, in answer to which I doe assure you of all faithfullnesse and greatest dilligence to manage your affaires (when comanded) for your most advantage. I must confess the trade of Constantinople, as alsoe all Turky over, is I believe (I may say almost all the world over) is much deficient from its former life and vigour, but the hopes wee have to see our marketts much amended (and with good reason) doth much rejoyce us. This city being the imperiall city and usuall seat of the Emperours did allways, through the presence of the Court, enjoy a briske and lively trade, which since the raigne of this present G[rand] Sig[no]r* has much decayed, haveing ever since he was crowned much delighted in pleasures of country and lived continually at Adrianople; but thankes be to God wee are now in expectation to enjoy him here, he having some time lay encampt not farr from hence, comanding all his seraglioes in this city to be new furnished and repaired, which makes us thinke he may continue with us, and it is a thing that all ways hath been observed, that never any city obtained a greater benefitt through the presence of theire prince, and the contrary by his absence, than Constantinople, but more particularly to his owne subjects. Sir, as for goods proper for this markett, are as follows: tin in barrs, leade in piggs, etc; detto white, detto, redd; Brazeile-wood; ordinary Brazeile sugars; ordinary loafe sugar; pepper and ginger, but this last and first at present in very low esteeme. Tinn, once the best comodity England exported, through that vast quantity which hath be sent into all parts of Turky, is become a drugge, but the consumption of it here is so considerable that it cannot long remaine so. The rest of the aforesaid comodity have mett with indifferent good marketts, the price current of which at the foot here of shall advise you. Sir, I have here with presumed to trouble you with directions for sortments of cloths, intreating if you thinke fitt to try this markett to keep as neare to the directions as tis possible, for the trade of this place being cheifly a mony trade and now trusting is forbiden by the Company, customers are forced to come into our warehouses with their baggs in theire hands, so are very nice and curious in theire choice of cloths, but am confident if you keep to any of these sortments need not doubt theire likeing. Sir, my small experience in the affaires of this place as yett will not permitt my giveing you a more ample account, so for what is wanting shall make bold to referr you to my master (Mr Wm Hedges) whose knowledge in the affaires of Constantinople I am confident equalles any man\u2019s, and of whome, if you will please to enquire, I doubt not but will assist you to the utmost of his power, having not else at present. \nTin, LD 26 in 27 per kintall, which equals English 118 pound-weight.

    "TEXT": "Your kind letter of the 17th of August has reached me safely, and also that for Matthias Trip in his absence as he is on a journey to Holland.\n I have seen what you report in both the one and the other about what is happening to commodities. I am grateful. It is much to be feared that iron-wares will achieve no great miracles this year. Because of the great numbers of your ships which have sailed from here, with more to follow, I can envisage a serious decline in prices. Since you say that the consignment of iron from Mr Trip is still lying unsold you can correspond with him about it in Holland. May God soon give us better times by a good peace settlement for the commonwealth of Christendom, as I said at length in my last. The twelve bottles and half-dozen knives have reached me but you have forgotten to add in your letter how much they cost. Meanwhile I thank you once again for your trouble and would be happy to serve you in return.\n Herewith goes a copy of my last-written letter, together with a note about the shipments. I hope you received long ago the bills of lading which were sent via Amsterdam from Gothenburg and by other routes. No fleet has been neglected. God grant that the ships may arrive safely! I cannot imagine where my letters have been lost. I sent some from here to Elsinore and I long for your reply.\n Much salt has now arrived here with the Dutch ships, so it has fallen from 13 dollars to 115 and 12 and may well fall lower. Since most of it which was sent on account is now gone it may well improve in the spring. French wine at 150 to 160 dollars per hogshead will also bea good commodity in the spring for whoever comes first to market. Iron prices have been pushed from 25 to 26 dollars per shippound though there is little demand now. Coarse iron is from 20 to 21 dollars.\n Herewith I remain, &c.\nEnclosed A note of iron for the year 1676 so far shipped to London with the y PP\u2019 following captains: 19 July: with Capt.

    "TEXT": "Above is a copy of my last letter. Since then I have had nothing from you, although I have heard that several others have had letters from you.\n This serves mainly to say that I have the opportunity to make a contract with Willem Momma about getting a quantity of brass manufactured at his works, for 600 slb or more, up to a total of 1.200 slb per annum, which is as much as his works can produce as long as he is running them. The works are managed in the name of his brother-in-law,! who is regarded as an honourable man and who holds a privilege from the King that the products manufactured at the works cannot be seized because of Mommia\u2019s debts but remain at the disposal of the owners. The conditions of the contract are that one must deliver copper at Nyk\u00e9ping and three months later one will receive back the same amount of brass-wire, paying 25 dollars per slb for the cost of manufacture. So far others have had things made on similar conditions and have been successful, so I am thinking about undertaking it too, even though it means negotiating with Jacob Reenstierna on the same basis. It will give both me and my brothers considerable worry to be involved in both works at the same time. I thought it might be a good idea to suggest to you that you might like to take a half share in the quantity contracted with Momma\u2019s brother-in-law for one year or longer, if you thought it advisable. We could then keep it in our hands, for it is a good brand and, according to the present price of copper, the copper-wire should cost us only about 250 dollars, which means we ought to be able to have it free on board for 282 or 283 dollars, which should yield a good pennyworth of profit in view of the advantageous rate of exchange. Please give it careful consideration and if you should decide to take part I will serve you for a reasonable commission and the goods belonging to your share will be loaded just as you order. I have not yet written to my brothers about making this proposal, so you could discuss it with them and convey your decision to me through them, wherewith I remain, &c.",

As far as I can learn about Swedish wire, there are about 900 to 1.000 coils which have arrived here by way of Liibeck. They are of various brands such as \u2018the Crown\u2019, \u2018the Rose\u2019, \u2018the Lily\u2019, \u2018the Three Crowns\u2019 and also some of the \u2018Crowned N\u2019 mark, but how much of cach and what varieties I cannot quite discover, though as far as I can understand they are mostly 4-and s-band. Few of the Swedish wire-sizes have been awaited here but those which someone has taken sold for 69 ML per 100 Ib. and one will hardly get them for less. Swedish garcopper is at RD 61 per slb, Hamburg wire is at 70 ML per 100 lb., copper kettles at RD 70 and sheet-copper RD 674 per slb. Barbary copper is not sold for cash here but is usually bartered against sheet-copper and the like, with about RD 20 per slb thrown in according to how good it is and how well refined. But if you want to know about the sale and demand for sheet-copper, I think it should not do badly. Please give it careful consideration. A ship was ready to depart for Bilbao before the winter but has been prevented by the ice. I believe it will have another opportunity to go as soon as the waters re-open. Yellow Danzig wax sells for 244-4, and seems to be in good demand. If you want some of this commodity please feel free to command me. God knows, I have a thorough knowledge of it and will endeavour to serve you in this or any other commodity to your greatest advantage. Thomas Whayman is loading up for Rouen and will hurry off as soon as the waters here are clear, which will take at least three weeks although it is thawing quickly. William Cutler is lying here at Dockenhooven! on the Elbe and is all right. Concerning the Swedish wire: if you would like some I think it would be best if you gave the order sooner rather than later as it will soon be bought up. Iam glad you found that you agreed with the account I sent and have madea record of it. I have checked your account of the 10 sacks of cotton and my current account, found them correct and have noted my agreement.\n I shall wait to hear by your next letter if you have obtained the little parcel of Barbary almonds within my price limits. As you said, plenty are expected and I doubt whether those who own them will be in a good position. If you cannot obtain them at 37s I do not want them, and if you have no success with them you would do well to have obtained a good bale of Ardasse below 9s. Let me know for certain in your next. For your news of what is happening in one trade or another I am most grateful and beg you to keep me informed of any pending changes, and also of the departure hither of Barker and Lawson, for my guidance.\n Enclosed herewith is the first copy of a bill of exchange for \u00a3150 sterling at 2 usances and 8 days, payable by Jacques Crop, assigned here by Samuel Zum Vorbrock. Please procure its acceptance and keep it by you until further order. I intend that B. Sirps shall make good the letter-postage for Debora van der Eckholt. He is expected here so I shall have it put in order then. Meanwhile please put it to one side. With cordial regards, I remain, &c.",

    "SIGN-OFF": "ft In my opinion, first to Lisbon, then to St Ubes.",
    "LANGUAGE": "DUTCH",
    "TEXT": "Your letter of the 26th of January only reached me yesterday. I am delighted that Steven de Geer, whom I have long served, has recommended me to you.\n Ihave noted that Captain John Chapman, sailing the ship Tomazine laden with wine from Bordeaux, has already left Bordeaux and also that Captain John Garret of the ship Concordia, coming from St Ubes with salt, was ready to depart so that, God willing, they might arrive here soon and that I should accommodate them with money\u2014to which I say that as soon as they arrive I shall not only supply them with the required toll-money as well as the ships\u2019 expenses but give them counsel and do as much as possible to assist them. And, if God permits, I shall at once inform you of their arrival and, in accordance with your request, keep separate accounts of what I have to pay for the cargo and for the ships\u2019 expenses. But all English, Scottish or Irish captains who pass the Sound have the liberty (as long as they are in credit) to pay the un-free Sound toll on their return journey from the Baltic, with the condition that the merchant to whom they are recommended here must enter into a pledge to the English Resident that, in the event of the captain not returning (which God forbid), they will immediately pay the Sound toll themselves. But since you say that I should pay it, and make no mention of using this English custom [so that nothing need be given here if the English style is used]* I shall follow your instructions unless you manage to order me to use the English right or style before the captains arrive to pass the Sound. An Englishman has to pay here for his ship\u2019s expenses:\n1. To the English Resident, Sir Paul Coryate RD2.1.8 2. Viergelt (in ballast, RD 2) a loaded ship, specie 4.1.0 3. Schoyss gelt, to the clerks, current 1.0.0 4. Sealed paper 4s; to the pass-writer 125, 0.2.0 5. The seal-presser, or stamp-~presser, 0.1.8 6. For the poor, 0.1.8 8.8.0 [sic.]\nA Dutchman, or whoever he may be, pays altogether as above, with the exception of the payment to the English Resident. And if any captain arriving at the toll-post to pay for his licence has no specie rixdollars he has to pay a premium on Danish crowns or cross-rixdollars of 3s per rixdollar. Before, he used to pay 4s but I have never had to charge my friends\u2019 accounts with more than 4s\u2014that is, 2s per rixdollar. If it should happen that a large fleet of ships all arrive together and bank-money is in demand, then it could cost 25s per rixdollar, though that happens rarely. However, the exchange rate at Copenhagen and here usually differs by 1, or 14 or 2 per cent, because there are few \u2018givers\u2019 here but mostly \u2018takers\u2019, and as soon as the captains arrive the money must be immediately ready, and that causes the difference. Thus one always has to dance to the toll-officers\u2019 pipe, as they well know, and the captains dare not blink an eye or they will be held up. However, come what may, I shall make your payments and you may be assured that none of your ships, on safe arrival, will be neglected for one quarter hour but everything required of me will be done properly. I hope to conduct myselfin such a way that I shall earn your desire not merely to continue using me here but to recommend me to others of your friends.\n If you also desire me to send you every post-day, or every 8 or 14 days, a notice of the outgoing or in-coming ships, of whatever nationality they may be, and where they may be going as well as what their cargo consists of, I shall gladly do it. As soon as I know your mind I will agree with one of the Sound-toll officials about how much I should give him for the notification of what I request; and since the toll-officials are not allowed to do it, except in secret, it would be well if it were kept quiet\u2014for your information. God be praised! We have had open waters here for the last eight or ten days, and five days ago a Bremen ship, which lay at Copenhagen all winter, came out of the Baltic and passed the Sound on its way to Bremen. And now, four days ago, two Copenhagen ships which trade to Spain arrived in the road-stead. They are Jacob Maertens Cloodt of the ship Charlotte Amalie, mounting 28 guns, as well as Pieter de Verver of Copenhagen, sailing the ship Christiaen Quintus with 30 guns, both destined for St Ubes and from there to Lisbon.} As soon as the wind is favourable they are thinking of setting off, in God\u2019s name. This for your information, &c.\nft In my opinion, first to Lisbon, then to St Ubes.",

    "TEXT": "For lack of anything to say we have not written to you for a long time, but we find ourselves with two of your welcome letters of the sth and 16th past from which we see that you spoke to Adam Groenen about the pack which was left lying at the water-side and that he has had it fetched away so that it can be sent to our brother-in-law Jean Meinss by a well-known captain as soon as the waters open. We shall look forward to that, thanking you meanwhile for all the trouble you have taken and also for the information about that well-known person, and furthermore for all the news and advice about prices and various wares. At the moment we can find nothing profitable to do because of a lack of sales and because the rate of exchange remains obstinately high. If it had fallen to about 33s we would have remitted something for our account so that when it came up for payment we could consider how best to employ it, but because the exchange has been for some time at 34s 9-10, and today is still at 34s 7g at double usance, we have not found it advisable to remit at such a high price, all the more so as we do not know how to use the money. You advised us to dispose of our Barbados commodities since their ships are expected by May with an abundance of goods. We have partly done so, and have sold the sugar, which we had been keeping for so long, at 6g per Ib. Yet it seems we were not wise to do so for it looks as if sugar is going to rise since it is beginning to be scarce here and in Holland. The stocks in Portugal are also not large, and those of black ginger have also been bought up. Ten or twelve sacks at a time could hardly be had for 44g but are now selling for 43g, and how it will develop only time will tell. Campeachy wood remains at 73 ML per 100 |b.; indigo guatemalo at 62\u20147s flem.; fine caribbean indigo is at 5s flem., and Aleppo galls are at 40 to 41 ML per 100 lb.; pepper is selling in batches of 10 to 20 sacks at 113g per lb., and in batches of 3 to 4 sacks is not to be had for less than 12g. It is a low price. We have a reasonable amount of it by us as we have been buying it at one time or another while the price got lower and lower in order to offset the higher-priced stuff, but it has all been at a loss and we dare not order any more. Fine dry wax sells here at 234g lem. and fine Turkish Angora yarn is sold by the English here at 74s flem. Currants are at 19 to 20 ML per 100 Ib. and oil is rather more keenly priced as it is all in strong hands. Seville and Portuguese oil sells at RD 60 to 62 while Apulian oil is at RD 6s per 820 lb. Grains are very dull and choice rye can be had for RD 52 per last. A quantity is expected from Hull and other places, and it is likely to fall to RD 50, if not below, for there seems to be big supplies. 400 lasts are expected from Magdeburg in three or four days, so some people are going to lose a lot of money. Buying up almonds is not going to make any great profit. Ardasse at 9s per lb. of 24 ounces is not too dear. When the exchange was not so adverse we still had one bale of it lying unsold which you had supplied us with some time ago, but because it was so coarse people would not have it, which is very annoying. The price here is at 13 to 1345 flem. with 102 per cent discount, which is very low. Because of this burdensome war, trade is falling away in Germany and everywhere else, and at the moment we see little prospect of a peace. The river is now open again, however, and we sce that one or two ships from France have arrived off the city, so we must hope that this will put some life into trade. Please let us know if there is any change at [London] in the prices of sugars, pepper, ginger, indigo, galls, Ardasse and the like, for which we shall be most grateful. If we perceive anything profitable and if the exchange begins to be more moderate we shall not neglect to give you some commissions, wherewith our friendliest regards, &c.",

With regard to iron I am also of the opinion that its price will remain steady in Sweden, partly because many works have had to remain at a standstill through lack of water and have made only a half of what they are accustomed to produce; and partly because so many English ships have been chartered to go to St Ubes that there will be a shortage of return ladings.\n I have contracted for about 1.500 slb of \u2018O\u2019 iron, which I shall keep to myself, so you cannot expect any to come this summer unless I have about 400-500 slb of the 1.500, which is lying ready, despatched in the chartered salt ships. The rest will come straight here, and if your iron prices improve somewhat I can have some \u2018G\u2019 iron shipped to you, which the wholesalers are also familiar with. So, of the two brands, none will get into other hands than yours, and it will take some time this summer before you are able to sell what you have. Now, as regards the \u00ae iron which, as I mentioned previously, had not yet been contracted for\u2014I shall not be doing so this time because that brand is not so very well-known [in England] and because the raw material is not available. It used to be made from one ore, but as the old mine is now finished and the new one is not so good at first, it may well be a year before the ore begins to be as good as it was. There is no more of the old ore near the works. There is some round about the \u2018O\u2019 works which is being mixed with the new ore, and at the \u2018G\u2019 works there is mostly old ore, so that is now turning out best\u2014voila! on nous enformes pour vos gouverno.\n Everyone says that the number of ships going to Stockholm is 18 or 20, and Iam sure that many will not find it worthwhile, particularly if they all arrive at Stockholm together and have to leave together. We must first see how things go in the spring. Apart from two or three ships which are now about to arrive from St Ubes, there are so many others that it may well be September or October before the Dutch ships will be able to arrive, for in April they first have to go to St Ubes, and I calculate the number going either to the Baltic or here is at least 50 vessels, which will result in very slow loading.\n If Mr Scheurman comes here I shall be able to learn from him how it will affect the freedom of the ships if they bring wine as well as other goods which are expected every hour. But of your ships I shall make no mention.\n Je vous remercie pour vos nouvelles. It will be an extraordinary summer if it continues as it has begun with Valenciennes!\u2014such a strong and substantial city taken at the first assault, so unexpectedly for besiegers and besieged! And now it is the turn of Cambrai. Who knows what may follow, for this year of '77 may bring forth some strange things. I remain, &c.",

    "TEXT": "My last letter was on the 9th of December last year. Since then I have received your welcome letters of the 9th of September and 23rd of November, from which I see that several of your letters are missing. Likewise Mr Green has had no letters from you so far and has no idea what has happened regarding the goods in John Stabler and their insurance, nor what has happened about those loaded in William Evelyn since you mentioned little about them in your latest letters. I hope that Evelyn has since arrived and that the goods have found a good market, so that I can be encouraged to continue trading to England in future. So far I have got little in stock, because my debtors have not kept their word. The reason is that, with the present demand for copper-wire, they have obtained from others better conditions than those they agreed to with me, as a result of which the proposal to have it manufactured by Willem Momma cannot go ahead since it has been necessary to take the said Momma to court. In addition, copper has risen to 228 and 238 dollars per slb. Undoubtedly this will continue as little has been worked. At Norrk6ping production has only just begun and at Nyk\u00e9ping only seven forges are working. But the Cronstr\u00e9m and Rosenstro\u00e9m works are being driven hard, though most of it is being made by Cronstr6m who has contracted with Van C\u00e9llen & Uppendorff. And because copper is at a high price abroad the copperwire made at Hamburg can hardly be sold for any trifling price. Because of the continual frost and lack of water that we had in the new year most ironworks have been ata standstill, so little iron will be produced this spring and iron of ordinary quality is selling here at 27 to 28 dollars per slb. Setubal salt remains at a low price of 114 to 12 dollars per last, but as less came in the new year than had been expected its price may get better, wherewith I remain, &c.",

    "TEXT": "My last letter to you was on the 27th of November, to which I refer. Since then I have been away from home, up-country. I have also been with Jacob Fahlgreen at the Kopperberg and have tried to be as helpful to him as possible. Mr Fahlgreen is still at the Kopperberg, putting his affairs in order, but I hope that within a fortnight he will be here again. I will forward your letter to him by today\u2019s post, without fail, and here inclosed is the letter which Mr Fahlgreen has written to you. As soon as Mr Fahlgreen returns here he will take the first opportunity of returning to London.\n Since my last letter I have safely received from London your welcome letters of November roth and 23rd, December 29th and January 16th, to which this will serve as a reply. Isee that trade in iron has been going badly. Iron prices here are high at 28 to 29 dollars. During the winter I bought about 3.000 slb of 3-inch iron and t-inch square iron which Iam expecting here from the works as soon as the rivers are open. May God bring them safely. I shall sell it all here. But I have also bought 300 slb of garcopper during the winter which Iam having made mostly into wire, but\u2014God willing \u2014I shall send you a quantity and I shall send it in your name. But the English Resident here has to give the captains a note or certificate that the ship and the goods are English and that the merchant is truly English, so everyone must declare on demand that the goods in the ship are strictly English. If you could write to the Resident to give me a certificate that the goods I have loaded are for your account, as is everything I have loaded, then the Resident is likely to help me. As you are getting 2 per cent you could well declare them to be your own and answer for them. Besides, I shall also be ordering all kinds of English merchandise, such as all sorts of cloth serges and bays, and as soon as I know that you have got me free to leave Stockholm waters I shall be wanting something from you. However, I intend to pay freight and duties here myselfat the rate of 12 per cent though, as you know, I could put it under our Swedish names if I have to make use of other friends. I await your answer to this.\n I see that Capt. Nicolas Payton has arrived safely at Harwich, God be praised! I hope he will soon reach London and deliver the 350 coils of brass-wire which he has for you. I trust you will do your best for me. Iam in no great hurry for the money and only want you to seek the highest possible price. I also expect at the earliest opportunity an account of the 1.280 coils whose proceeds, I see, amount to \u00a31.666. I had expected \u00a3100 more. I hope that the RD 6.751 23s Dutch current-money has been remitted to our friends in Amsterdam, although I dearly wish it had been remitted net, as I ordered, for I have ascribed it to our friend that way in my books. This is all by way of reply; may God bless you, &c. \n[P.S.] The letters I have just received will be immediately forwarded, each to its appropriate place.

I must admit that I have been somewhat negligent about answering them in good time, but I would have been prompter if I had been fortunate enough to find any advantage which we could extract from our correspondence. However, the scarcity of opportunities and the fact that prices are falling nearly every day and also that those in [England] are closely related to those here means that one can hardly earn any profit. Even if one imports something carefully, without extra-ordinary costs, one can casily suffer loss ifthe least thing happens. So I have been unable to make any ventures in getting anything bought in [England] and trade with Sweden is at present so depressed that our friends cannot export anything, and there is nothing specially worth doing in that area because the high freights which one must pay to English skippers eats up the profit, and as a result commissions from those regions are declining greatly.\n However I am extremely grateful to you for your good advice and your willingness to be of service, to which you will always find me equally willing to perform anything you may care to command.\n In the last eight days grains have risen at least 20 to 25 per cent because of strong demand from Brabant. Such large amounts are no longer coming from England, and if the imports from [England] should cease there is likely to be a major rise, but most people are of the opinion that the high market price will bring plenty from [England].

    "TEXT": "I received your letter of the 29th of February from Captain Jan Garret of the ship Concordia when he arrived at Setubal (God be praised) together with six others from [England] four or five days ago. The order to let him have a suitable cargo of Setubal salt was also received and will be performed according to instructions. As regards the good measure and quality of the salt, together with the promptness of its despatch, you may rest assured that no one will be more advantageously dealt with, but the fourteen days allowed for loading are too short for any satisfactory despatch, for it must necessarily take a month, and even if one could get it clear in less than a month one would have to wait for his accompanying ships, which will need to have at least four or five weeks. Please bear in mind in future that it is no use limiting the captain to twelve or fourteen days, more or less, if it states in the charter-party that he is to leave in company with others. Furthermore, I am quite sure that I can give better despatch and as much speed as anyone if he is loaded in a more leisurely way, which also permits one further advantage in the measurement of the salt.\n The price of the salt and the accompanying costs are always agreed at Setubal and there has been no change in them for the last fourteen or fifteen years. However, during times when there are 50 or 60 ships together loading, they sometimes have to remain lying there for eight or ten weeks; and it sometimes happens that when the opportunity arises to join suitable, good company which would allow some of the ships to depart, or they decide to join a foreign convoy, they will spend \u00a350 or \u00a360 for the benefit of speedy despatch. But the same haste often occasions great prejudice in the measure and quality of the salt. Otherwise, as I said above, the charges and the price of the salt are always agreed. Here at Lisbon the price follows the market, though it is usually cheaper than at Setubal where the measure and quality of the salt is more advantageous and better than that here\u2014for your advice. I had news from Mons. Steven de Geer at least three or four weeks ago that you had chartered the above-mentioned ship, and probably yet more. On their arrival your orders will be punctually followed, but there seldom occurs any opportunity to draw bills on [London] which has to be done on Amsterdam where the rate of exchange is also more favourable. At present it is at 62 to 624g [flem. per cruzado]. Whether the total costs of the above-mentioned ship are drawn on De Geer (as he instructed) though by way of [London] or Amsterdam, it will always be by the most favourable rate, the success of which you will learn in due course.\n Since Swedish shipping has been prevented from coming here by this dreadful war there is a great shortage here of all Swedish wares. Iron could at present fetch between 3.000 and 3.200 reis per quintal of 128 Ib. A Swedish shippound counts for about 294 lb. here, and on each quintal falls about 450 reis duty and charges. Deals, according to size and quality, are 30 to 40 to 45 crowns? per 122 pieces; beams are likewise (according to quality) 500 to 1.500 and 2.000 reis per piece. Masts of 15 to 24 palms are, one with another, 70.000 reis per piece. Tar, 3.000 reis per tun\u2014free on duty and charges since the purchaser usually pays these. Only with iron is it customary for the owner to pay the duty and expenses\u2014for your guidance. I take the liberty of troubling you further with a bill of exchange for \u00a388 12s sterling at 8 days sight drawn on Johan Crogher, value of myself though stated pro forma from Pieter Meyer, arising from an assignment which the said Crogher received from Sam. Sowton drawn on one, Thomas Thussen, iron dealer in [London] in payment of a bill of exchange passed for my account on the said Sowton. Now a year and a day has passed during which the said Crogher has kept me waiting, notwithstanding that I have written to him several times and exhorted him through a friend in Amsterdam but he never answered a single letter, only writing occasionally a note to the friend in Amsterdam and putting him off with fair promises. At last he wrote to my friend on the 12th/22nd of December last year, informing him that he had received the proceeds of the assignment from Thussen and that he would remit the total to me through his brother, Captain William Crogher, at a rate of exchange of 6s 7\u20148d per mil reis, together with other small details, for which I have been waiting. Now his brother has arrived at Setubal with these latest ships from [England], but with no letter, no news, much less any remittance from Crogher, which is very un-mannerly. I beg you to obtain friendly satisfaction for the aforesaid bill of exchange and after deducting something for commission and similar small expenses remit the remainder to me here so that I can at least get something. The enclosed letter to him is going open, which you may close at pleasure, forgiving me for troubling you with such small matters. I remain, always ready and willing to serve you in anything you may be pleased to command as De Geer is so close a friend, yours &c.\n[P.S.] Mr. Steven de Geer has also ordered me to load three boxes of china apples, marked \u2018L.D.\u2019, which are loaded with the other three you ordered.",

    "TEXT": "Your letters of the 26th of September, 25th of January and oth of February have just been received all together. As for that of the 26th of September, there is nothing which needs to be said except that Mr Boor has given me the answer that he remitted the 1.755 d{ollars] 16 [6re] to Rouen more than three months ago and has also had news that it was accepted, so there is nothing to be done about that bill of exchange though it will be retained until further order because letters are going so unreliably now. It is strange that until now you have received nothing from either of the bills of exchange which I remitted to you on the 18th of October, namely \u00a3140 and \u00a3100 on William Benson, whereof I sent the first and the second copies. When I come to Stockholm I shall send the third copy if I receive no further news from you meanwhile.\n So far I have been able to learn nothing from your agent. My servant writes me that he has travelled to Fahlund? so I wrote to learn what his intentions were. I have now written to him again that he should find out through Thomas Perman and Oloff Hansson if he wants to load any wire for your account in the Thomazine so that there is room for it. Regarding these persons, I know nothing other than that they are good, especially Oloff Hansson whom I know to handle good and great affairs with promptness. The other I do not know so well, though I do not doubt his reliability. I shall keep a wakeful eye open to watch your interests, notwithstanding that these folk are adequate enough.\n Regarding the ship with wine, as soon as it arrives I shall do my best to take care of it and follow all your orders and communicate with your agent. I had thought that one would be able to get this cargo in as Swedish, duty-free, but I have now received news that this cannot be, because this year no goods or ships will enjoy Swedish duty-freedom. If this should be the case for the ships bringing salt it will fall very heavily on the goods coming in and going out on the Thomazine, as it makes a difference of one-third in the duty. I now hope that a further order will come asa decision about it has been deferred by the King. It is to be feared that the ship will arrive at just the moment when there will be an embargo on all shipping since it appears that our war-flect will be in the Daalders? at about that time. Ifsuch is the case, and if one cannot enjoy the full freedom from duties, I do not think it will be advisable to load this ship for your account, because even if the first eventuality does not occur it will be burdened with the high duty, and it would be better if your returns were loaded in the salt-ship as long as the increase in the toll is in prospect. However, I shall always act for your greatest advantage as circumstances offer and as soon as the Concordia has arrived I shall take good care that it is fully laden by others. Mr Boor will also have a consignment to load. I shall do my best to sell the wine for cash as far as possible, but so far as I can learn from others these goods are not often sold wholesale for cash. Now that the returns need not be held up I shall be able to go to Stockholm immediately at the end of the month, so your agent can meanwhile prepare everything. Wherewith regards, &c.",

We have checked it and find that the customs, scavage, passport and town duties amount to a great deal and are much above our estimate. Madame your wife and Mr Peter Joye, in the year 1672, when we sent them 400 coils from here, only brought \u00a332 16s into the account for customs, scavage, passport and town duties, but for these 1.650 coils you put down \u00a3167 5s, which differs considerably. Please check it again and if you find a mistake please correct it, as well as deducting the extra 4 per cent commission which you have incorrectly put down. Our brother David wrote to us that he had agreed with you that you would only charge 14 per cent in the account for the brass consigned to you by John Green. Otherwise we have found no error in the account, which we are returning herewith so that you can correct it and interline what has been omitted.\n We see that, instead of having any money for us in cash, you are actually out of pocket.

Since then I have received the original, and that of the roth and 23rd of November as well as those of the 22nd of December and 16th of January, most of them all at the same time. I have also the account which you sent with them, and the letter of the 23rd of November which you said was sent via your servant. It was delivered by Mr Klitzert,* and from your servant I have heard nothing. And I understand from your letters that none of mine have come to your hands which I wrote on the 24th of August, the sth of October, the 16th of October (under cover of Mr Klitzert) and the last of 11th of December under cover of Mr Perman (as I supposed). I am astonished that you should have received none of them. Coming now to reply, I must say that I have partly checked your account and find that you have left out RD 2.000, which you paid long ago to Mr De Geer, which was properly entered into my books in conformity with your letters, and entered it shall remain. If you find yourself falling short on other items they ought not to have been sold in that manner. I can also not approve of the bad debts, for you wrote nothing to me about them between 1672 and 1675, although the account was settled annually. The last time you sold anything to John Skepper? was in 1672 and it was over a year before anything was paid, when you credited him with \u00a353 7s 4din 1673. Now I happen to know that others sold to him in 1674 and have been paid, and it was not until 1675 that he absconded, in which time one could have easily demanded the debt. I corresponded for a long time with your predecessors, Jan de Buck and Marescoe, and before that with their employer, Mr Jacques Bove, but I have never encountered anything like this in these unseasonable times. You have also reckoned all the interest on the debts at 6 per cent though you know it should be only 5 per cent. I know perfectly well that you should not have to carry bad debts, but I know even better that one ought not to be kept in suspense but be informed in a business-like style, annually on the closing of accounts, of any outstanding debts\u2014of which, during four years, I was told nothing. So please understand that I shall not close this account until everything is sold and the final total agreed. Then we can reckon the interest as it ought to be, so please make an end of the sale as soon as possible.\n I was greatly misled when I was told in writing that one could sell 400 slb per annum of black kettles, or the like, and thus to send so many pots to England which you were to sell to the Guinea Company or to Spanish or Muscovy merchants. It is a good product, and what I have had manufactured recently I have been selling at Stockholm to the Russians and get more for them than I would abroad. You will please make an end of them and not quibble too much about the price, but do not sell to people who are unreliable about paying, as Skeppart was. I would not be insisting on this if you had kept your fine words to have a watchful eye, as you could and ought to have had over the last three or four years. It is unnecessary to write any more, as you can be better informed from your correspondents at Stockholm about the way trade is. At this place there is nothing to be done, and I commend you, with regards, &c.\n[P.S.] If you participated last year in sending calamine here from Amsterdam, please inform me as I have previously requested.",

    "TEXT": "On the 9th of March and the 27th past we received our Hendrico\u2019s letters from [England], saying that he had arrived there safely on the 25th of November last year. And as he has had the honour of being consulted by you regarding trade he has requested us to give you advice about what is happening to it here. Thus we take this opportunity of free postage by the departure of six French ships (two for Leghorn and four for Marseille) to trouble you with our notes about the goods which are called for here from [England], as well as about those which are sent from here to [England]. In addition we describe some assortments of Dutch linens, perpetuanas and calculations about linens with 28 stuiver coins and also Dutch steel. From these you will be able to see what you may profitably turn to account. If you should be inclined to make a trial of one thing or another we beg that we may be favoured. You may be assured that you will be so well satisfied that you will want to continue. Firstly, the principal goods brought here from [England] are \u2018Londons\u2019 \u2014of three sorts, each selling according to its quality, which are called perpetuanas\u2014lead, and iron wire as well as other goods which you can see from the enclosed note. The goods which [England] most demands from here are silks (Ardasse, Legis or Serbassi) Angora or Beybesar yarn, cotton wool and cotton yarn, gall-nuts, testick-wax,* or hoeden wol, aniseed and [\u2014blank\u2014]. Secondly, the goods from Holland on which a good penny-worth can be gained are the smallest cloths, Danzig-steel, brown gum-lack, stockings of grey \u2018bont-werk\u2019,? and (above all) most preferred are Dutch textiles which one must exchange against Turkish yarn from Angora or Beybesar and against cotton-wool, gall-nuts, aniseed, testick, mastic, palm-wood and wax; also against silk (Ardasse, Legi and Serbassi). In bartering for [silk] one must always provide half the value in money, and for all other goods one-third in cash, so that the costs of freight, consular charges and other sorts of outgoing and incoming goods can be paid for. The most useful and profitable specie are Lion dollars which are currently being struck in [England] and sent here in large quantities, together with 22-, 26- and 28-stuiver coins out of Holland, which are packed in between the cloths. One can make a good profit on these coins, as well as on Danzig-steel which can be got in Holland for f-10 or f.11 per hundred pounds, free on board. The latter is presently selling here for LD 84 per cantar? and is sometimes at LD 10 or LD 11 according to the amount in town. Gum-lack is LD 14 per oque,* grey bontwerk stockings are LD 63 to 7 per hundred, first-quality cotton-wool LD 7 and secondquality LD 52 per cantar.\n For further news of what is happening in the course of trade please look at the accompanying price-current, and\u2014as we have said\u2014if you are disposed to see some advantage in making a trial we beg that we may have the honour. You will have satisfaction and enjoy quick returns, as time will tell.\n Six days ago we reccived letters from a friend saying that the great Sultan had publicly entered Constantinople in unusual pomp together with his mother and the Grand Vizier.\u00b0 Nobody here had believed it would happen. And as the great man is now trying to keep his head he has demanded the head of his brother, but since his mother is very protective of him no one knows how it will turn out. Two days after the said great lord entered Constantinople he forbade any women to be scen on the streets any more and one afternoon, sitting in his seraglio by the sea-side he saw sailing by some vessels with women, which ran aground. He had the poor women drowned. If things go on like this one must wonder what is coming next.\n For the last five days there has been seen here, for three hours every midnight, a comet-star rising in the north-east among the stars on high. It is about an ell long and hovers a little towards the due-north. What this may signify the good Lord alone knows, to whom I pray that He may keep you in good health, and closing, remain, &c.",

    "TEXT": "My last letter, to which I refer you, was sent from Gothenburg. Since then I have only just received, yesterday, yours of the 12th of April from which I see what you have to say about the copper coins. As it is now forbidden to export them I can send no great quantity. Nevertheless I have ordered them to send you some from Gothenburg and will write in the morning (God willing) that they are not to send you more than 4 or 5 tuns. However, I remain of the opinion that this commodity must rise and hold its price since no garcopper of any importance can be sent from here as long as one has to pay the un-free duty\u2014which means that not one shippound of garcopper can go from here for less than 450 dollars\u2014 which, reckoning the \u00a31 sterling at 25 dollars, means \u00a318. Now, as soon as you receive it from Gothenburg I shall be glad to learn at once what can be done with it. At present wire costs 290 dollars per shippound; iron is at 30 to 32 dollars, which are good prices, and voyage iron is 33 dollars, so I do not think that one can send any iron to [England] if one wants to recover the money invested. Things are very bad here with regard to freedom from duties. Whoever brings in no salt, ammunition or ordinary woven cloth must pay the un-free duty, which makes a difference of at least 3 RD on a shippound of wire. Consequently business is quite extraordinary here at present.\n Your 2.000 coils of wire will have been sold long ago. If not, you should sell them at once as 3.000 coils are going from here to [England]. So far, little has gone for Liibeck, Hamburg, France or Holland, but I shall be sending some to these places in order not to spoil the market in [England]. It will be explained to you more fully in our next letters that Mr Van C\u00e9llen and I have separated and that from now on you are to accept nothing for our partnership unless it is signed by us both in our own writing. Please bear this in mind. With regard to anything I may send you (which could be considered as sold, free-onboard, when it is delivered) I shall draw nothing on you before the ship leaves the Daalders. I am delighted that the business is going forward in Parliament! and look forward to hearing the outcome at your convenience, wherewith\u2014besides offering my unqualified services\u2014I send warm regards to you, your wife and whole family, remaining, &c. 1 A reference to his bill of naturalization, now passing through Parliament (see [275] n. 1).",

    "TEXT": "I find I have your letter of the 17th past. It is astonishing how things are going in Sweden with regard to the purchase of iron, the English buying everything that appears for 30 dollars per shippound. My brother has sold 3.000 to 4.000 slb of his * \u00a9\u201d on commission for that much and Boor has also sold some of my \u2018O\u2019 and others besides similarly. There were so many ships there that they did not know how to get any London-bound cargoes for \u00a32 or \u00a324. I would guess that when these ships arrive in London there will be not a little undercutting in iron prices, so I think it would be most advisable if you sold what you have of mine before the ships arrive and iron gets into too many hands. As for pan-iron we must look into it. There will be little or nothing coming this year so it should eventually find its buyers, but we must let it lie for a while and be patient.\n It is now too late to have 13- and 13-inch iron made. If only I had had your letter earlier, there were 300 slb lying at Stockholm which have now been shipped to [blank]. I shall now be getting some letters from Sweden which I am sure will yield a bad account unless Cletcher has bought tar for you in good time, for I am afraid there has been too much in the country.\n Mr Botte tells me that he has acquired for himself all the tar that goes to London, and that he has consigned it all to you so that it remains in few hands. Let me know if you have anything concerning the wine lading. I see from Boor\u2019s letters that Cletcher has sold the salt for less than 10} dollars. That is too low. Boor has also sold some for me but I think he would have done well to leave it. There is plenty there but nevertheless the price is too low, wherewith I remain, &c.\n[P.S.] Voyla bien, mechante nouvelle pour le danois encore, qu\u2019on le balence aise et toutefois i] n\u2019en sera pas encore quite a ce pris, comme nous aussi du nostre\u2014so it must still go on, et puis une paix avec la france separee, voyla encore mon opinion.",

It is true, as you write, that it cannot be brought out of Sweden for less than \u00a312 without loss, but it seems that it is the humour of the English nation to sell immediately, cost what it may. It is beyond reason but in these latest letters I have been informed that the English are now buying iron for 30 dollars which was last year selling at 25 dollars, while the salt which was sold last year at 12 dollars is now selling at 104. You can well conceive what a difference that makes. One should be able to say that, because it was bought up at such a high cost, the price of iron must rise. In other places they would hold on to it, but not the English! They must sell, cost what it may, so once again I beg you and order you to sell my iron at the market price, for large amounts will be coming from Sweden.",

I have already let you have my views about these matters and if you are willing to undertake the business for me in [England] on the following terms we can try each other out for this year, and if 1 am satisfied (which I do not doubt) I shall be glad to continue with you, vizt.:\n 1. In accordance with your request, the goods will be sent to [London] with the exception of 80 lasts of pitch and 100 lasts of tar, which will be ordered for Hull as you asked. 2. On their arrival you will do your best to sell them from the ships according to the prices which] shall, from time to time, recommend and if these prices cannot be obtained the goods are to be stored in a good and convenient warehouse until such time as an opportunity offers, for which one ought not to be in too great a hurry as these quantities are not large. Furthermore, it means I can sell as I choose, and as the prices here are \u00a322\u2014 {22+ flem. for tar (which, with discount and rebate amounts to f.120 net) my present advice would be that the consignment sent aboard Robert Young and due to arrive soon should not be sold below Lu sterling for the tar and \u00a315 sterling for the pitch. It should be sold at 3 months time precisely, so that the bills of exchange can be paid; and in order that I may sleep all the sounder I would ask you to stand liable for debts, which you are better able to settle than anyone, having knowledge enough about your customers not to give credit to anyone other than reliable people.\n If you do so I shall:\n 3. allow you 2 per cent commission, and for interest (according to your demand) 4 per cent per month for your outlay on freight charges and bills of exchange. Further: 4. [have agreed not to draw on you more than Js per last on the tar and \u00a37 per last on the pitch from the time the goods arrive until the time when they are sold, when you will always allow me to dispose of the balance in such a way that what remains unsold from time to time is only charged with \u00a35 per last of tar and \u00a37 per last of pitch, including all expenses. I have no doubt that these conditions will please you and that you will consent to them, handling the costs as if they were your own, on which I shall rely and await your decision by your next letter.

Thank you for news of what is happening to trade in [England]. I see more prospect of a decline than a rise in indigo prices at present since large amounts have arrived with the East India ships. I understand that in Spain and Portugal corn is scarcely satisfactory. Some say itis also so in the region of Nantes in France, but that it is abundant in England and that large amounts have been contracted for in Spain. I shall be glad to know what truth there is in this, and how much a last of wheat will cost in [England], free on board. Fish and grain from [England] are probably in some demand in Spain. Exactly what demand there is I do not know, though with the great shortage they will have to do the best they can. Here, God be praised, we have had a reasonable year, although how large [our crops are] one does not know yet. With cordial regards, &c.",

    "TEXT": "Your letter of the 18th of May, together with a copy of the same, reached me only four days ago, and I also have one of the 19th past which arrived safely today. From these I have seen your news of what is happening with regard to the pitch and tar trade in England. Thank you for the information, and since Mr Botte has contracted to undertake the business and has instructed me to arrange the shipments to you, I have consigned to you the following (which will be followed quickly by the bills of lading)\u2014in Captain Robert Young, 62 lasts of tar at 13 barrels per last (consisting of 472 lasts of Stockholm tar and 20 lasts of Viborg tar at 12 barrels per last) and 20 lasts of pitch at 12 barrels per last; likewise with John Chapman 2335 lasts of tar and 542 lasts of pitch at 13 barrels per last; likewise in Henry Sutton 285 lasts of tar and 6, lasts of pitch. John Garret and Francis Benson are still lying in lading and when they have their full cargoes I shall send you news of it. More will follow shortly so I hope you will be able to have the required amount. Since Mr Botte already set sail a fortnight ago on his journey to Amsterdam by way of Liibeck I hope he has arrived long before you see this and has corresponded with you about what is necessary for this business. It is true that in Kalmar and Vastervik one can obtain no more tar for any money, and from Gothenburg, Halmstad and Viborg no more is expected.\n Thank you for offering your services to me, I shall bear that prospect in mind when the dear Lord grants us peace. Because of these troubled times we citizens have had all our business taken away and have had to leave it all to foreigners while we patiently wait for better times, which the dear Lord may soon grant.\n Because there is little iron in stock here the price is high, and the recent severe winter and great thaw have restricted many works, which are remaining at a standstill, to which the floods of the spring and the subsequent great drought have contributed not a little. So far this year Holland has not ordered much iron and most of it has been sold to Englishmen resident here.\nWith cordial regards, &c.",

If the last two ships carrying our 10 packs of whale-fins have departed for Genoa we shall be glad to hear and await the expense account. Concerning our remaining whale-fins, we had hoped that the ravages of the French in Greenland would have caused some considerable alteration,! but since we have heard nothing about it from you and since the price here is weakening again because the ships have returned home with very good catches, we have decided to dispose of ours cheaply and likewise request you to sell at \u00a3105 sterling [per ton]. And if you cannot obtain that please, without delay and by the first opportunity of a good ship, send them also to Genoa for our account but in your own name. Consign them to SS. Carlo Dominico Cichi & Co. and inform us promptly when it is done. Concerning the pending sale by your East India Company, we had expected further information from you. We are now advised that it will happen soon and that large amounts of pepper are likely to be sold, so we have no doubt that it will be going cheaply. If you can obtain it at 6d [per lb.] please buy 20 or 30 bales for us, and if you have to pay 63d get no more than ro to 15 bales. We will promptly arrange your reimbursement. Enclosed here are the cargo lists of another 6 East India ships which have arrived. The Company are expecting that all their pepper will have to go cheaply.

    "TEXT": "STOCKHOLM (i) APRIL 1677\n[D]\n received yours of the 26th of January and oth of February.\n In reply, you will have seen by my previous letter that because I am engaged in a suit with Willem Momma the proposal I made to you cannot be put into effect. I now see that you are introducing difficulties by suggesting that the business was hindered because I could not make up my mind to participate on grounds that are no concern of mine. With regard to the insurance on John Stabler, the reasons you give for the high premium do not satisfy me since the difference between the 4 per cent given by Francis Townley and the 7 per cent given by you on the same ship and at about the same time is too great. It would be a big enough difference if one granted an extra 1 per cent for the reliability of the insurers but in addition you put down another 1 per cent for the clause that, in the event of loss, payment would be made without deduction, and on checking through your earlier letters I find that in one of the 16th of June 1676 you wrote that such a clause made a difference of only 4 per cent; and that still leaves another 1 per cent which you cannot explain.\n I beg you to believe that brass-ware is a commodity which needs to be handled with skill. I cannot commend anyone who is neglectful about arranging insurance but to give it away in haste and to have no regard to what an insurer puts is also not commendable and takes away a large part of the profit.\n Thope you have done your duty in selling and have made some recompense by selling at a good price. Brass-wire remains at about 270 dollars per shippound, garcopper at 226 to 227 dollars, ordinary fine iron at 28 to 29 dollars and St Ubes salt at 12 dollars per ton. With which I remain, &c.",

    "DATELINE": "AMSTERDAM 14 SEPTEMBER 1677",
    "TEXT": "I refer myself to my last letter of the 3 1st past. Since then I have been at The Hague for a while concerning business affairs and on coming home found your letters of the 24th, 28th and 31st ditto, in answer to which I cannot agree to sell any tar for less than \u00a310 tos sterling, be it at Harwich or at London, and if our friends will not agree to that please store what belongs to me. They can sulk, and they can receive what is due to them if they need it and thus be able to pay up all the more promptly. And I am not obliged to follow them because of any disputed points about which they make claims, as set out in your last letter of the 31st of August. For although I have been assured by the Directors in the contract settled on the 3rd of April this year that for a period of two years they would not sell tar for England to anyone but me, our friends cannot guarantee that no Viborg or Stockholm tar besides mine will arrive, firstly because it could be stolen and secondly because malicious people here or at Liibeck could buy up assortments and have them sent to [England] in order to make claims, for which I have no desire. So, as I have said before, it is best to sell, which I urge you to do. If you cannot arrange any freight charters for Stockholm at \u00a373 sterling per last you do not need to go to any further trouble. I shall wait until next year, and it is much better that one does not get too much this year in view of the quantities which have arrived from Vastervik and are yet expected,\n Thank you for mentioning the idea of chartering salt ships for St Ubes next year. I shall think about it and may well decide to charter a consignment if it can be obtained at \u00a35 sterling \u2014i.e. from St Ubes to Stockholm and from there to [London] at eighteen tuns of salt per last and a similar lading in return. Let me know more in due course. In your letter of the 28th of August I have found the account for the cargo in Captain Robert Young, consisting of 62 lasts of tar and 20 lasts of pitch, which you have forgotten to sign. Please get it right in future. I have checked it and find that you have charged me \u00a35 85 for brokerage, short-change and false money at 3 per cent, which according to my contention ought not to be charged to me as it is not the practice here and is covered by your commission. For if one has regular tar customers one does not need to deal with brokers, and ifa cashier receives false money he ought to pay for it, for what he does not see with his eyes he ought to feel in his purse. So I expect you to reimburse me for this item. Secondly, while you have rebated two months from the total proceeds (so that the goods have only yielded 1 per cent) you have additionally charged me four months interest on expenses totalling \u00a3216 95, which is also a mistake. For if you have reckoned the full rate of interest on this \u00a3216 9s so much the less ought you to rebate for two months. There is also a mistake of \u00a32 35 3d which you will please credit to me. Apart from this I find your account correct. You were pleased to tell me that you have written to Mr Cletcher at Stockholm that the tar and pitch loaded in the Thomasina were absolutely for your account. Now you may remember that you have promised me before to tell no one for whose account these goods were going, so I have said nothing to Mr Cletcher nor anyone else at [Stockholm]. I beg you always to keep it secret, for one does not need to give anyone unnecessary information. Regarding the hire of a warehouse, I rely on you to arrange it as carefully as possible. Iam glad that, following my instructions, you will not sell the tar for less than \u00a310 10. I shall rely on that, and am in agreement with you onall the conditions so far as concerns debts. Since you write that there are only four or five [customers] that one can trust I beg you to let me know their names so that I can inform myself about them. I am very apprehensive about this because I have had my fingers burnt before and if you could remove my uneasiness on this score I cannot see anything to sever our correspondence provided that you follow my instructions in selling. I beg you to give it further thought and let me know your good ideas. I can assure you that if we once get our relationship settled on a firm foundation you will be able to earn with me a handsome commission.\n Please do not forget to send the Canary sack to Stockholm at the earliest opportunity, addressing it to Claes Wilkens, and if you are able to charter some ships, as you said, please address them to Wilkens and to Burghermaster Hans Smitt at Viborg. Ishall not neglect to recommend you to my friends, but it will not be necessary to do so for Breda? because if I had not had his previous recommendation I would not be corresponding with you now.\n When the opportunity occurs I beg you to send me sixty bottles of good Canary sack, and make a note of it on my account.\n With regards, I remain, &c.",

I also advised you what difficulty my contra party yett makes about Mr Perman\u2019s and my father\u2019s bale, for they will not lett mee have a farthing but put it all in security for the bale, and that you could help mee to bee master of my own if you did send me the bale back againe, then I would put all what I gett in your hands this is about the contents of my last. I have received sinc your wellcome lines of the 22 June, where of I doe see that you have not received a word of answer on all your letters to mee about your bussinese here, and because your affaires doe not require to keep mee here you give me order to come back by way of Gottenborgh before September. For answer, your 3 letters of the 29 December, 16 and 25 January I did not recive before the 28 of March and sick on my bed occasioned thorrow an onlucky faal I had on my right side upon a iron plate which keept mee 3 weeks to bed, and that is the reason I did not answer your letters before the 21 Aprill. Yours of the 26 January with copie of the 25 ditto, 16 February with copies of the 9 and 13 ditto, 21th March, 2 and 4 Aprill I all received the 12th May when I came to Stockholm, all which I did answer the 16 ditto per via Gottenborgh at large. The 21 May I advised you about William Momma\u2019s bussines, and if you did send Spanisch silver for this plase that it would turne to a good account, and 9 June advised you the arrival of the Concord; 13 ditto the arrivall of Thomasine; 16 ditto the sale of your loading salt; 23 ditto the contract which I had made with two merchants here, Mr Oloff Root and Thomas Cupp for a parcell of English manufactuars for about \u00a31.500 sterling att 16 per cent profitt to bee delivered eigther here or att Gottenborgh, they paying all charges whatsoever except assurance money. I also did send you there\u2019s memorandum for to buy the goods affter. The 26 July and 10 July sent you also the copie of the 23 June. Sir, this is my declaration both for the time when I received your letters, also when I have answered them, and thought it dos not, may bee, answeer to your expectation yet I doe hope that you will not in the least deminidge your good will you have for mee. Whatsoever I have done amise I pray for it, and what is to bee mended I will loose noe time to imploy my outmost power for to doc it. It may bee that some frinds have seen mee here that went for England, but truly I did not know so much, for I did write per Gottenborgh which I thought was the securest way and recomended my letters to Mr Robert Clarck that hee should send them away with the very first opportunity of frinds and ships. If Mr Clarck have not observed my orders but letten the letters ly hee is much to bee blamed, for hee aught att least let mee know so much that I might have governe mee there after. Yesterday I did write to him for to know what he has done with my letters.\n Toward the beginning of September, please God, shall I live in Gottenborgh for to goe for England ifI don\u2019t get contrary orders from you before, and about that time doe I expect those goods I have written for. As soon as the ship Concord is departed this port I doc intend for to goe up in the country for 2 weekes for to settel my affairs in as good a order as I can before I returne for England. By this inclosed letter of Mr Cletcher you shall understand what her loading is. You will also have the account of the salt, the neet amounting to 16.143 dollars 6 ore copper mony. Mr Cletcher is gone from hence to his workes at Axberghammer and did give mee order for to make up the account with the master, which I also have done, and has given meea recept for 1.595 dollars copper monys, where of hee has payd all the port charges, The recept I am orderd to send to Mr Cletcher with the first post. The master has in for your account 40 tillts of deals, which cost with the toll and all 195 dollars 4 ore; 4 fadomes wood to stow the tarr cascks cost 28 dollars, the port charges amounting to 481 dollars 18 ore. I should have bought you some good birtch wood but here is non to bee had for mony. However, I have given order to the master thatt in case hee meets any boats with good wood that hee shall buy you 4 or 6 fadoms and stow it up from the tarr. The wind has been very good this 8 days for Mr Chapman. I hope hee shall have a short voyage. Having noe more to inlarge but wisching the ship Concord a good voyage and after my humble service presented to my mistress and the rest of the house I rest, your faithfull servant.",

    "TEXT": "SEPTEMBER 1677 VENICE\nIn answer to your letter of the 27th past, we must say that pitch is certainly not required here and is even less valued than tar, so it would not be advisable to send any here. There are about soo barrels of tar lying unsold in town, and the demand is not very great because of the small amount of sea-borne traffic here at present. Two months ago we sold some for D.32 with 6 months discount and 30 per cent tare for the oaken casks (which are those most in demand). Below I have set out some calculations for your guidance. No other tar comes here except some from Muscovy: most is from Sweden. Pitch is indeed made in Dalmatia but we have never seen tar from that area. Between now and June next year about 400 casks could be sold. Lead is at D.41, pepper at D.51 and both are likely to rise higher. Currants at Zante are at 35 R. pta. since the crop is meagre. Russian leather, D.52 per lb., with 8 per cent tare.

I reckon that ships leaving [England] will not do bad business for I understand that wheat is being bought at very reasonable prices.

On the Exchange credit is entirely dead and one may shortly hear of further failures, so if the Lord is not merciful to us in granting a good peace many honourable folk will be ruined by this lengthy and disastrous war. One hears of nothing but losses, and business is so bad that one has to run great risks at sea from capers and other dangers. Instead of profits, commodities are frequently yielding losses, for in general business has been ruined and most kinds of merchandize are at such low prices that it is astonishing. Nothing is selling because demand is very poor. The whole of Christendom is troubled and the war has impoverished so many people that wares simply do not sell. There are many folk who, inspired by the low price of various goods, sent large amounts here in recent years in hopes of a peace and a rise in prices, but they have been greatly deceived in their expectations. The older the goods the more they are slighted. Capital is in confusion* and we can see no sign of any improvement\u2014enfin, it is better to sit tight than to invest, and that is the reason why I dare undertake little, for if one balances the risk against the small prospect of profit neither the one nor the other is encouraging. May the Lord drive away these dark clouds and give us a long and durable peace!\n The burghermasters have allowed Van Raey a free pass so that no one can molest him fora given time, on the grounds that his business is not in such a bad way but has been overtaken by bills of exchange and some goods have been delayed here and there. The Lord will settle everything for the best, to whose protection I commend you and, offering my services, remain, &c.",

Since then I have received yours of the 7th, by which I see that you have not yet bought the 10 sacks of Smyrna cotton which I ordered because ofa lack of ships coming this way. The Elbe here has been full of ice but is now navigable again and there are two ships which have arrived here from [England], and since you said that you were arranging for a ship to come here I assume you have performed my commission and await the account and the bill of lading.\n Ishall maintain the price of your remaining cotton at 14g, for it ought to fetch as muchas it costs in [England], but because it is now an unfavourable time of year one ought to take that into consideration a little and wait until there is further demand. I have sold nothing of our Ardasse yet. Iam holding it at 15s and it would have sold readily if Persian had not arrived here who brought a good quantity overland through Poland and ruined the market. One must have patience. As I told you, ours are too coarse and stringy. In future, obtain something better, I shall regulate myself according to the way things go in [England] and if 1 discover anything good or likely to succeed will let you know. Iam glad that Mr Martens Ecking has taken the \u00a320 remitted and placed it to my account. It can serve towards the commissioned cotton. With this letter Iam remitting you for that account \u00a350 at double usance on John Banks negotiated here with Jan & Herman Luys at 34s 4g. Please procure what is necessary for the enclosed first copy of the bill of exchange and credit my account with \u00a385 16s 8d.\n I was glad to hear that you are not involved in the recent bankruptcy here and hope you are likewise free of those which have since followed, as I am, God be thanked! May He protect us from wicked men. I shall be glad to hear more of what is to be hoped for from [England] regarding peace and war, and also if there are any changes in commodities taking place. There is little worth mentioning here, partly because of the many bankruptcies and scarcity of money. Apulian oil costs RD 92 per 820 |b. for cash; currants are 30 to 31 ML per 100 lb. with 8} per cent rebate, since a quantity has arrived here from [England]. Barbary almonds are at 32 ML per 100 lb., Aleppo galls at 45 to 48 ML, brown ginger 44 to 42 g per lb., and scraped ginger at 9 or 93g with 83 per cent rebate. Of Swedish copper-wire there are only about 250 coils here. Most of it is \u2018Great Crown\u2019 and the residue \u2018Crowned N\u2019 and it cannot be had for less than 70 to 693 ML per 100 lb. Hamburg copper-wire is at 71 to 72 ML, while copper kettles are at RD 70, sheet copper at RD 68 to 69, Swedish garcopper RD 644 to 65 and Hungarian plates RD 60 to 61 per shippound. If there is anything in which I can be of service please inform me and command.\n B. Sirps has been here and as far as I understand has not yet returned to [England]. If he arrives in [London] you will know how to demand the letter-postage from him, as already requested. I shall expect my current account and hope to hear how much Iam to get for the rebate of duty on our Ardasse, so that I can make a record of it all. Meanwhile, with cordial regards, &c,",

For lack of material I have never before had the honour of writing to you, but I am doing so now on the recommendation of my good friend, Mr Reinholt Garlinghoff, principally to let you know that I am sending to you at [London] for my account Simon Morris! with so large pieces of copper-sheet manufactured here, weighing Slb. 10.9.1, and 50 coils of Hamburg brass-wire, weighing 1.411 Ib., as you may see from the enclosed bill of lading.

This is only a trial, and if I find it advantageous and you do not reject my correspondence I shall continue to send you further consignments\u2014but do be careful always to sell to reliable people. I have the opportunity provided by another ship of sending another so coils which are standing ready. Since it is at my own risk I do not want to venture too much in one ship.

    "TEXT": "Your welcome letter of the sth past reached me on the 21st instant. The following will serve as a reply.\n It is true that, because of the great quantities, wine will not sell here in the least. There is enough lying here to last for two years, and it is in so many hands that one cannot undercut prices without selling at a great loss. To tell you the truth, there is never any profit which an isolated individual can make here for there are too many old-established wine merchants who obtain the wine on their own account and drive no other trade. These people have all the taphouses under their thumbs so itis quite impossible for anyone to compete against them except with loss to his colleagues. Also there is no truth in the idea that one can send it for an immediate sale, much less procure remittances, because this is a commodity which is sold on long-term credit. Thus, I could not give your friends full satisfaction, but if I can be of service to you or your friends with any other commodity you may freely command me. I would be grateful for your recommendation, and you may be assured that your friends will be completely satisfied, for I shall take care of their interests as if they were my own. The brandy will all be sold, some for 300 and some for 280 dollars per hogshead, according to what Mr Cletcher tells me about that which he has taken back since his return from the country. But of the other, little or none is sold, and according to what Mr Cletcher tells me he is on the point of selling to one of the wine dealers. I cannot see him getting more than 140 dollars per hogshead on average, for there is much bad stuff among them. Your friends have been very badly served by those in France. I can obtain 160 and 180 dollars per hogshead for the best sort, and the longer the time it takes the more loss by leakage occurs, so that from two bad barrels the best one must be chosen.\n I am very relieved that you will be suffering no loss by the cargo since you are not involved, but I wish that those who are involved might get as much profit as possible. The un-free toll and expenses are too great. May God transfer their loss to someone else! You will be further informed about what happens regarding the sale. For your report about what is happening in trade I thank you\u2014it may come in useful. It is very obvious that our goods this year in England will cost [\u2014missing\u2014]. Ordinary iron is selling for 26 and 27 dollars; fine iron at 28, 29 and 30 dollars of the sort which was previously selling for 33 dollars, but this decline has come about because there is no shipping-freight available for [England] or Holland, and many goods are lying about. Garcopper costs 244 dollars, and wire 336 to 340 dollars per shippound. Salt is now put out of the market and the first [to arrive] has been sold by me for 134 dollars per ton, and that is for two ships\u2019 lading, for your information. Just how things will develop in the spring time will tell, and you will be informed.\n You complain about the Osterby and Gimo iron, that it is not as good as it used to be, yet that ought not to be so for I can think of no change which has taken place. Please let me know at once, exactly, what it is about which you are complaining. Winter is now close on our heels, so the waters are beginning to freeze. Wherewith I remain, &c.",

I reciprocate them, wishing you all the prosperity and good health you could desire for yourself.\n It seems that I must remain patient about my Marglitzer linens since they are of the good old-fashioned sort and not of the kind currently being made. I believe they were once without demand for six years but were then much sought after and their price leaped up. That time could come again for they are no longer being made. We have so many bankruptcies daily here that business is at a standstill and all the goods which had been sold on credit are now at rock-bottom prices, so that the commitments I have made for myselfand others (to whom the Lord God may teach a lesson) have become hateful. However, could you procure some indigo guatemalo which could be delivered here for 54 schellings flemish, with 8} per cent discount? Also some 300 or 400 barrels of figs of middling quality \u2014that is to say, well-conditioned and dry (only they must be well-sugared). I bought similar good parcels from some Englishmen for 73 ML and 8 ML per too bb., cash, on which those fellows made a good profit as is known to me from participation in one such parcel. I would gladly take a share with you in a consignment, but please work out whether it can be delivered profitably at the above-mentioned prices and before your country becomes involved in a war. I trust that the ships arriving will not be full of it and moreover that you will obtain the quality I described. Take very good care to see that it is not damp, or so black that it is unsaleable. I await your answer, and also your feelings about grains, pepper and oil. If Provence almonds, newly-pickled, can be delivered here at 30 ML per 100 |b. (with 82 per cent discount) please see about it at once. I remain, with friendly regards, &c. \n[P.S.] I hope you have no interests involved in Octavius Buschman who has gone bankrupt as (God knows) others may, I fear. One is in a state of continual apprehension. If you will stand surety for money at my disposal in return for 3 per cent per month commission, please let me know for my guidance.",

    "TEXT": "Iam most gratefully obliged to you for the various letters I have received from you in the course of the year, with useful information about trade and what has been happening with Swedish goods. As I have been selling my products here at home there has been no material on which to keep up our correspondence. However, this letter is occasioned by the fact that Commerce Councillor Nicholas Preus is going to London from Gothenburg with a certain royal commission, and I have asked him asa friend to settle the account concerning the blank farthings which was in Mr Burkin\u2019s hands. I understand he has died and I want to recover the remaining effects, which I transferred some time ago to Jeremias van Racy in Amsterdam. Since I understand that Van Raey has employed you before in his affairs Iam sure that you are well-informed about the matter, so Iam asking you asa friend to supply Mr Preus with all the information you may have and give him good advice about how this task may be handled with the greatest circumspection.\n For this, it is necessary to know:\n 1. Who is now managing the estate of the late Mr Burkin and what do you know about such person?\n 2. In what relationship does the family of Burkin stand with the Controller of the Mint, Sir James Hoare?\n 3. If the copper farthings are still in use, and if new farthings were minted for 1675, \"76 and \"772\n 4. If the remaining 182 barrels of farthings are still in the hands of the Burkin family, or whether they have been delivered to the Mint?\n 5. Whether, of the whole consigment of 326 barrels,? only 144 were paid out of the Mint, or whether perhaps Mr Burkin retained them all in his hands and kept a running account with the Mint?\n About this and anything more which may serve to illuminate the task of Mr Preus, please inquire closely and let him know. I shall be most greatly obliged to re-pay you with gratitude, friendship and service for any assistance you may be able to give me. The reason why I began to get involved in this trade was to help my brother Abraham Cronstr\u00e9m, in so far that the deliveries might be completed according to contract, and it was my intention to give the commission to your dear wife, Madame Marescoe. But my brother warned me off, saying that the firm was not reliable but on the contrary suffered from great internal jealousies and that nothing but quarrels would ensue since Burkin had been promised by the contract that he would have an exclusive commission; and ifit came into other hands it would be regarded as raw copper yet pay duty as if it were manufactured copper\u2014as it mostly did afterwards.\n I shall expect a regular report about what happens in this and other aspects of Swedish trade, especially in what ways one can get coal to Stockholm at the best possible price. I should also be glad to know the price of malt and hops in England, for my guidance, with information about how English malt compares with that of Danzig or Riga. \nWith regards, I remain, &c.",

You should since then have received our letter of the r5th instant, so we shall expect no more remittances during this low exchange. It is good that you have deposited \u00a3500 sterling with the East India Company at 5 per cent interest per annum until the 25th of March in the hope the exchange will meanwhile improve. We would be well content if you placed amounts with the Company on the same terms, as the money comes in, since according to your promise there will be no commission charged on it. It would oblige us greatly. We sce that the prospect of war with France has diminished [in England]. There are many here who hope that Parliament\u2019s firm resolution may well dispose the King of France to peace, which should shortly be proclaimed. We remain, with cordial regards, &c.",

    "TEXT": "My last letter was on the 4th of March in which I sent you a bill of exchange for \u00a3200 sterling drawn on John Croger so that you could get it accepted and return it, which Iam accordingly waiting for. Since then I have received both your letters of the 19th and 22nd of February, to which I must say that I am very sorry you have refused to accept my drafts. This is the first time that has been done to me. It might be the case that they were drawn payable to a good friend of mine and were only done pro forma, but while the first is true the second is quite the contrary. You should know perfectly well that when I draw a bill of exchange which affects the honour ofa merchant I am careful that I do not over-draw, for 1am aware that any one who accepts bills without the security of effects is giving me credit, and if he is not inclined to do it he will not pass them. Therefore I have to know that he has sufficient effects, which on this occasion I have done. But, from the beginning, I have noticed that you have had no inclination to accept anything unless it was covered by effects which you have not sold so I have not asked, thinking that with God\u2019s help I might avoid having to do so. But with my effects sold at a fixed price to reliable customers, as you have done, no one can claim that I have been served in conformity with the original proposal on which I began to correspond with you. Iam more astonished that you have not been willing to honour my drafts than you are astonished that I drew them! After all, to accept drafts and pay them as money comes in from the sale of goods does not require one to venture any capital. And one is getting a handsome commission. People without capital can easily do that. If one wants more, one must stipulate better conditions. I must declare that Iam heartily annoyed that you have done such dishonour to my drafts, all the more as I know you were not lacking sufficient means to fulfil them. It never occurred to me, with regard to you personally, that you would not be sufficiently confident about the reliability of your customers to give me credit for my effects and that I would thus come to suffer some loss. So far, God be praised, I have found no reason to complain about my correspondents and it would depress me to find the first grounds with you\u2014God forbid! Now patience.\n Ishall expect a sale account and current account from you, which you will please send by the next post so that I can see how we stand with one another. I can make calculations about it myself since nothing is forthcoming on my latest drafts. If the consignment which went to Bristol has been paid for please remit me the proceeds in good bills payable at sight, for you have already deducted your commission.\n Since I see that the English are demanding \u00a34 sterling for freight on a last of tar from Stockholm, and will not sail for less, please do no more about it. I shall arrange for everything to come here first, which I can have done for f.18 per last at the most; and I can get it carried from here to [London] for 18 or 20 schellings per last, so my freight will not amount to more than \u00a33. And by that means I hope to demonstrate to you that you will have no reason to complain about having to advance money on my behalf, and I shall no longer have to live in fear of insults to my drafts.\n May God give us a peace, to whose protection I commend you and remain, &c.",

I urge you to see to this because of the bankruptcies which are happening everywhere. And when I see the results and find them satisfactory I shall not only continue to send even bigger consignments which I have lying ready at Hamburg, with Tomloo and other friends, as well as here (for I have a 6-year contract, not only with His Highness the Prince of Hanover and Wolfenbiittel for all the garcopper belonging to him, but also to manage the copper mines for others in this country, for whom I make all their brass and brass- or copper-wire) but also bigger quantities of copper and wire.

The Riksdag was held recently in Helmstadt and because I learned that there was an English ship lying at Gothenburg whose captain was thinking of returning to England I decided that I would go over to England aboard this ship. But then I got news from Stockholm that my wife is very unwell and thus I have to cancel my journey and travel from here to Stockholm, which is the cause of this letter and my request that, as a friend, you will buy me the goods set out in the memorandum below and send them to me in the first available ship on the same conditions on which I sent you goods last summer through Mr Piltarffand subsequently wrote to you about\u2014namely, that you will buy the goods and ship them in your own name and deliver them to me in the river or waters of Stockholm. Mr Pilcarff has already informed you, as you may remember, of the same conditions on which you sent goods to Oloff & Nicholas Torne last summer.\n I am sending you enclosed herewith four first bills of exchange drawn on Samuel van Breda, to pay RD 1.400 in Amsterdam and RD 600 bank-money in Amsterdam, which RD 2.000 you will get paid, place to account and employ as instructed. The goods which I am likewise shipping with this Captain Hiel are 300 pieces of copper money plates, which are going under the name of John Harwitz! who serves James Leyell and Callender. He has been here and is sending the plates to his father and has written to inform him that I shall be receiving these 300 pieces of plate from him. But since I cannot come over I beg you to receive the 300 plates from Harwy, pay his expenses and then sell them. Place the proceeds to my account and employ them as instructed. In themselves the proceeds will be too little for the proposed purchases, but with the first ships leaving Stockholm this spring you will receive 60 slb of copper-wire, which are already lying ready at Stockholm. I had thought of sending them last autumn but had no opportunity. In addition I have another so slb at the works in Norrk\u00e9ping which I shall get as soon as the waters are open, all of which I shall send to you. I shall make good anything more you disburse on my behalf at the rate of $ per cent per month interest until you have the payment for my goods in your hands, in accordance with the terms of the contract which I sent over last summer through Mr Piltarff. I also hope that the remainder of the money due has now come in. As I said in the last letter I sent over \u2014 another time you must not sell to people who do not pay up promptly. Furthermore, | beg you on receipt of this to serve me well with good quality wares at reasonable prices. You will buy the dozens and kerseys in Hull and the others in London, and let them all go in the first available ship under your name for delivery to me in the river before Stockholm. I know no other way of doing this except according to the contract, by which you will pay the customs or duties in England, insurance on everything and the Sound tolls at Helsingor. In return your profit will be reckoned at 12 to 15 per cent. I know no other way except on these conditions, which I must insist upon.

    "TEXT": "I find myself with your letters of the 8th and 29th of March, and must thank you for your report concering the salt ships which are coming from St Ubes. I shall be glad if you would share with me anything more you may learn about them. In my opinion, Sweden will be adequately supplied from here this year, and if more comes from England matters will be worse than they were last year. But if there is a war, England will be needing the salt itself. Your iron prices will have to be higher if one is going to bring it from Stockholm. And the freight charges will have to be lower, which is likely to be the case if all the salt ships arrive there and push down the rates. According to my calculations \u00a316 will scarcely be enough with these freight and exchange rates.\n I shall expect an account of the iron, and with it a report on how much pan-iron from that works you are going to keep in your hands.\n The wine ought not to be going straight to Stockholm where it is now so cheap that it would be better if it came directly here. However, it is best that you sell it and close the account, and if these damaging exchange rates continue for a while I would prefer to have my money received there, unless arrangements can be made for investing it in something else. Let me know at once how things stand so that I can write and tell you to whom the money should be given at Stockholm.\n I shall expect to get an account of the 56 slb of wire which still remains unsold, together with an account of the wine.\n In Sweden they have had a bad winter, so many works have been poorly supplied and although they believed that iron would casily maintain its price there is at the moment not much demand here. I shall be glad to learn your opinion about it in [England]. Some French goods are still not prohibited here. We still hope for a peace, but if it should be delayed it might well happen that England will go to war with France and then we might decide on a general prohibition also. But that would be to embargo oneself, since no ships would be able to sail and no one would be free, and one would know all too easily if anything came from France. Je suis de vos avis touchant la gerre. Si vous en pouvez apprend quelque chose par M. Leyonberg en avance vous m\u2019obiligerez. The Riksdag in Sweden has ended well, with money and men supplied from all sides. Si je ne me trompe cette ann\u00e9e encore gerre par tout et peut estre revolutions ass\u00e9 \u00e9trange. Then one will have to begin to make peace, commencent de I\u2019un ou de !\u2019autre bout, car le generale cannot. I remain, &c.\n[P.S.] [hope this week to clear up the business with Clignet and am sending over to you an express so that it can go from you to Dublin. The two packets of old letters have been received today. I see that if the packets are thick the postage is higher. Many letters go from here for the Sound by way of Liibeck and then by sea.",

When they fall due we shall procure payment and, after deducting our commission and brokerage, make you returns in good bills. Van Breda makes some difficulties about paying us on these bills since they were endorsed to you by Thomas Perman without instruction to follow his order.

What I can principlely recommend to you from Holland are barraganen from Valentia* which wil cost there about 38 a 40 florins per piece. There wil be shipping from Holland comeing hether about 2 month hence or something more. Sir John wil get wel by his cinamont but when t\u2019was bought in the exchange went at 36s 6g or higher: now I hear its fallen to 34s\u2014is a great difference. In case of warr shipping from Hambourgh hether wil runn great danger unless they come for the Downes and thence with English or Dutch convoy. Hetherto our English shipping have bin inployed in that trade but ifa breach follow with France it wil meet with a great obstruction. Then waxx may rise here and I beleive fall at Hambourgh. It must be that with 3 seales, whereof I observe Mr Boverie sends considerable parcels from London. The freight from Hambourgh to London is but little and from London hether very reasonable. What comes directly from Hambro wil cost more freight and if the custome in England be but little that may henceforward be the best way to bring it hether. I shall endeavour speedily to cleer Mr Hayes\u2019 account, and is all at present from, Sir, your humble servant. \n[P.S.] I have lately bought at San Sebastian about 350 quintals of whal fins for Sir John, whereof all but 100 are gonne and these roo are loaden there which I expect [hole] first good weather about. If you thinck good to accept thereof I have writt Sir John offer them to you. They will stand in about \u00a390 per ton landed in England, and they are since risen 15 per cent at San Sebastian. They cost all ready money.",

One is living here almost as if one were bound hand and foot, and the iron, garcopper and copper-wire which comes to market here is mostly sold to strangers. There can only be one person in a hundred who is currently exporting on his own account, and when anything does get done it is in the name of someone overseas, which still carries its dangers. Apart from that, we are living in great ignorance about what is happening abroad since our correspondence has been taken away and it can easily be three months before one can get any answer from Holland and [England]. This creates uncertainty, so that it is nearly impossible to get anything insured, and when correspondence is removed in such a way the insurers are not happy to venture without taking a high premium, which is enough to smother any profits which the owner should have enjoyed. And if the ship should on its way suffer any mishap in these circumstances the insurers are very evasive, so that one has to write off half one\u2019s capital. But for you in [England], who have a punctual correspondence from all places, it is much easier to arrange anything for your own account. Garcopper is presently very cheap here, at 235 to 236 dollars, and it may well fall to 230 dollars. Fine iron, serviceable for London, is at 30 or 32 dollars, medium quality at 27 to 28 and coarse anchor iron at 25 to 26 dollars. Copper-wire is at 270 to 280 dollars. So, if you want to arrange for something to come on your account, please keep me in mind and be assured that you will be as well served by me as by any others in Stockholm. Meanwhile, people are in good hopes of peace and trust that it will not come to a rupture between England and France. This would be the best for the whole of Christendom, and I trust also that all the princes who are engaged in this war will feel it too and already have their share of weariness.\nWherewith I commend you to the loving protection of God, and remain, &c.",

In my opinion it would be best now to see which way, and how, matters develop between England and France.\n Iron is now readily fetching 32 dollars for fine quality. Wire is 290 and garcopper 236 to 240 copper dollars per shippound. May God grant peace! There ought to be something to be done with copper, especially when the East India Company in London wants to make its yearly contract, about which you could do a lot through Mr Lethicullier who I beg you to grect heartily with my dutiful respects. Likewise, something could be done with voyage iron but in these troubled times it is best that it remains at home. I shall set them to work on it. Similarly, one ought to be able to agree with the Tar Company for 1.200 to 1.500 lasts of tar and 300 to 400 lasts of pitch yearly, as you mentioned, but during this war I do not believe the English here will allow it, unless it could be arranged in [London] under the pretext that His Majesty the King of Great Britain wants to be assured of having such a yearly quantity in the country and, accordingly, His Majesty has agreed with you (or someone else) to procure such a quantity and consequently forbidden (or, at least, will not permit) anyone else to bring in such commodities unless you (or whoever it is in whose name it is done) shall permit it and unless he charters it or orders it through you. That could turn out well, and if you would like to take a half share I would do my best here and you could arrange your half in [London]. And with the ships that fetch the goods we could send other commodities of one kind or another on which something could be gained in [England], and now is the right time to be thinking about it, for when we have peace there will be many standing ready to do so. Thus, if you have any inclination to take part, I beg you to let me know at once and I will see what is possible to arrange here.\n Lacking the account of the plates which you have sold I shall be glad to learn how much they rendered, for my guidance.\n At the carliest opportunity please send me six good watches and chains that work correctly, of the kind which you bought for Mr Hedenstr\u00e9m, since I have been asked for them by good friends.\nBless you, and with heartiest regards I remain, &c.",

As I told you in my last, Captain John Bate arrived here safely, and I have been diligently trying to sell our ginger as quickly as it can be received from the ship in order to reduce expenses, but it will not succeed because I have been obliged to bring it in to the warehouse. Although I have been superintending for the last two nights the captain has only delivered 193 sacks and I shall not pay him his freight until all the rest are received.\n Since then I have sold 150 sacks, namely roo to Mr De Heusch and 50 to Adrian Justus at 33g with 8} per cent rebate for payment in bank money. They will collect them in the morning and I shall try to sell the rest so that I can send you the account. In my last letter I ordered another 100 sacks of brown ginger to be bought at 15s or below, and if you are interested in going halves let us take 200 sacks. This I now confirm. You know what sort of quality to obtain. What I have here is good, and the freight is very reasonable, which will make it easier to have a coarser quality. It will be useful for your guidance to know that if the sacks are rather bigger the expenses here can be better managed, for one has to pay just as much tare, brokerage and other expenses if the sack is of 100, 120, or 80 lb., so if the quality is good the bigger sacks are to be preferred.\n I hope you have performed my commission for white, scraped ginger. Regarding Bermuda tobacco, as I said before, please do not pay more than sd, and for good Barbados sugar do not give more than 21s 6d to 22s, buying 10 butts for my account or 20 butts for us in partnership. And it may be useful for your guidance to know that one makes the most loss by the tare on the heaviest butts, for here the tare is 14 per cent while in [England] it isas much for a heavy as for a light butt.

Because a rupture is still foreseen please take care that what you send to me is loaded in ships which are going with convoy. It would be very unwise to load it in German ships sailing with French passes for I fear the English will not suffer it. I hope you know how to guard against that.\n Ihave been told today that Nath.

    "TEXT": "With today\u2019s post we safely received your very welcome letter of the 27th past, whereby we have seen what you asked to know about the trade in whale-fins. In reply, we can tell you that we seldom receive fins from Biscay, for our friends in Holland send us as many as we can sell here. Those most wanted here are the blackest or the biggest kind, but no small ones. Furthermore, we see that you say that those from Biscay weigh from 4, 43 to 5 Ib., per piece, so they must be nearly all of the same size, and they would sell for 16s[oldi] per lb., more or less, according to quality. The white ones should be thrown out, otherwise they cause offence here. The black and dried ones will all sell as there are none in town apart from those in our hands, for your information. Dutch fins are also from 3, 3+ to 34 lb., and 100 ]b. Dutch-weight amounts to 150 lb. here for wares which do not perish, such as lead, iron, pepper, or the like, and whale-fins of one type always spoil more than the other since they are shipped moist.\n A piece-of-cight is worth \u00a35, or 100 s/oldi]. Charges on fins, pepper, lead as well as many other goods are few since they are mostly sought after duty-free and only have to be stored. Concerning warchouse rent, it is ordinarily (though contrariwise for all cloths, bays, says, linens) a duty charged on the seller of 1 per cent ona valuation of the goods, though the prices have been once again raised. Pepper sells at present for 105 soldi per lb., great lead at \u00a3164 per cantar which is the same as 100 Ib. Dutch or 150 Ib. of theirs. If there is anything in which we can be of service you may with all freedom command, with heartiest regards, &c.",

For your instruction, it is not advisable that we should sell anything at present but rather let the others undercut each other. Our time will come. As already mentioned, I shall not be arranging for any more ships to go to [England] this year. In 1676, over 3.000 lasts of tar and 600 lasts of pitch were sent to England, which were altogether consumed before any of mine arrived, but this year, besides my total, less than a quarter as much will be shipped. Concerning what you propose about the conditions on which I can draw \u00a34 per last on tar and \u00a36 per last on pitch at the arrival of the ships: for the reasons you allege I shall draw no more than \u00a34 per last on the tar until it is sold, but once sold I may (if I need to) always draw the surplus on each ship\u2019s lading without waiting for the money to come in. And on the pitch, since each last of pitch costs me twice as much as the tar, I would gladly see you allow me to draw \u00a38 per last, which is not unreasonable. As for bad debts, I shall guarantee you, and likewise against the risk of fire (which God forbid!) but I cannot agree to allow you to sell to others than the previously specified tar-buyers, since you judge the danger of bad debts to be sO great.\n You request that I should reimburse your outlay if you need it: I am always quite willing to reimburse you within two months of being informed by delivering over to you such effects as will suffice but on the condition that you only charge 4 per cent commission on their account. On these conditions, and provided that you always follow my orders about selling, we can again continue to deal with one another.\n On these conditions I have today drawn, payable to Joseph Deutz\u2019s order: \n\u00a3400 \u00a3300 > at 3 usances \u00a3300 together \u00a31.500, \u00a3500 at 24 usances.\nwhich bills of exchange I send herewith for acceptance.

Cella soit dit en passant pobr vous faire voir que la mizere est grande, et qu\u2019en mattiere de marchandise nous sommes dans ung temps ou le plus seur est tousjours de suivre le cours. Le petit navire dont vous nous parlez est arriv\u00e9 de Hull au Havre avecq 24 lests de goudron que nous avons ordonne d\u2019y descharger et de vendre ce que l'on pourra, en nous envoyant icy le reste, car ce n\u2019est pas une marchandise que requiere la garde.

Il n\u2019y a pas heu de la perte sur les cuirs que ont este acheptees par della et aurions vollontiers souhaitte que vous y eussiez fait quelque chose. L\u2019on a affiche icy un declaration par laquelle le Roy entend que les hollandois ne payent a l\u2019advenir des marchandises qu\u2019ils apporteront en France sur le pied qu\u2019elles estoyent taxees par le tarif de 1664, que sera ung grand accroissement de commerce pour eulx, et fort prejudiciable au vostre, car par exemple le charbon qu\u2019apportent vos navires taxe a \u00a3120 du 100 de barilz, ils n\u2019en payeront que \u00a34or, l\u2019estain sos du 100 qui est a \u00a312f Ios, ainsy consequamment de plusieurs denrees, comme fanons, huilles de ballaine, drapperies et autres que l\u2019on reduit a I\u2019antien droit, de manier qu\u2019ilz attireront ainsy la navigation pandant que vos vaisseaux demeureront sans employ au regard de la France. Avec tout cella, la paix n\u2019a pas este encore ratiffie par les Estats, mais on la tient pourtant imancable, voire mesme qu'elle sera generalle, non obstant les grands apprets que vostre estat continue de faire pour la Flandre. Dieu nous donne ce qu\u2019il voit mieux que nous nous estre necessaire en achevant. A prezante nous venons de vandre encore 200 torches de fil de latton a ung de nos ouvriers de dehors a \u00a385t.

Nous voudrions bien en leur consideration et en la vostre pouvoir vous rendre quelque service qui vous fust agreable. Pour satisfaire a ce que vous nous demandez nous vous dirons, qu\u2019il est vray que Mons. Hersemitte comme I\u2019un des directeurs en cette ville de la Compagnie du Nort recevoit les marchandises que en venoient pour le compte de la ditte Compagnie, laquelle avoit des previlesges qui consistoient en ce qu\u2019ils payoient moins de drois que les particuliers, mais cette Compagnie est a present comme estinte. Nous ne scavons sy a present que la paix sera faitte ils reprendrons en quelque facon ce commerce, mais nous voyons qu'il y a desja long temps qu\u2019on travaillea la liquidation. Ils ont vandus tous leurs navires et tout ce qu\u2019ils avoient de matteriaux et chose propre pour la construction, ainsy nous croyons qu\u2019il ne viendra plus de marchandises pour ce compte-la. La principale consommation du bre, gouildron et chanvre est ce qu il en faut pour les magazins de Rochefort, dont les achapts ce font publiquement pour toutes les choses dont l\u2019on a besoing pour les magazins, et presentment ils sont assignes pour la douze et quinze de ce mois.

Quand a ce qui est de la consommation qui s\u2019en fait dans cette ville, on nous dit que deux ou trois cens barils sufisent, a cause que l\u2019on ce sert du brais sec d\u2019Arcanson? que est a beaucoup meilleur marche. I] faut toujours du gouildron, comme aussy des cuivres en platte; cela vient ordinairement d\u2019Hollande mais nous estimons qu\u2019on les peut tirer a meilleur march\u00e9 d\u2019Angleterre. Le chanvre seroit de longue vante, a cause de la grande quantit\u00e9 que s\u2019en recueille en France et qu\u2019il est a bas prix.

Since then I have received your letters of the 29th of January, rsth of February and 12th of April, and as you make no mention of mine I suppose you have not received them. I understand from you what is happening with you as regards trade, and also concerning rumours of war. We here live in hopes of peace, but what pertains to trade\u2014which is now mostly carried on by the English\u2014 is bad. Some ships have arrived at Stockholm, and two ships loaded with coals from Newcastle have reached here. Iron is sold at 31 to 32 dollars per shippound; brass-wire is at 290 to 295 dollars per shippound (which is what was at \u00a36 tos with you) and as there are only 4.000 coils in stock I trust that you will do your best with what you last had, for there will be no great quantities coming. Because of the bad winter the works could get no supplies and thus both the brass works and the iron works were at a standstill most of the time. As far as Iam concerned, I am thinking of not exporting anything as long as the war lasts, and am nota little surprised that the pots and kettles have remained unsold for so long and that people attribute this to their bad quality. But I know otherwise, for the pots are not to be bettered and the kettles are no worse than those I have always sent to [England] or Holland. If they were in Holland they would not remain unsold one month, but it seems to be contrived that they simply eat up expenses in interest and warehouse rental. I shall await an account from Hiebenaer of such expenses as you may incur through the law-suit! and have them paid, and I shall make good such expenses as you may have incurred for me concerning Townley.

    "TEXT": "My most recent letter was on the rst instant, to which I refer, and enclosed herewith follows a copy of it. lam writing this only because I find I have not replied about the two invoices for the 3 packs from Hull and the 14 packs from London, which I would have answered long ago if [had not been prevented by my serious illness. So this will serve as a friendly comment on the 3 packs of goods from Hull, which I received as per invoice. I was well-satisfied with the goods, but I do not know where the \u00a35 6s 4d comes from since W. Skinner brings \u00a316 12s 3d into his account for expenses at Hull.\n But, my dear Mr David, I have something to say about the 14 packs from London! Some of the wares are good, and some of them are bad, though I found the total number correct according to the invoice. The pack No. 1 with 30 pieces of northern kerseys was so bad that I cannot describe it. You put them down at 17d to 18d and 109d, but if you offered me such tattered goods for 10d I would not have them! They are not half as good as cottons, and are nothing else but trash. So, likewise, are most of the dozens. I have never seen such wretched goods. You must have bought the dozens and kerseys from a Quaker[?].1 He has put two pieces together, but he must have been a scoundrel who sold you the 30 pieces of kersey and 40 dozens. He has deceived you like a fool. You know that I ordered you to buy the dozens and kerseys in Hull and not in London, and to have three kersey pieces wrapped in one but not two dozens in one. In London one can get no good dozens, only old, wretched things which seem at first like boards and full of worms, and the inside piece is so awful that I am ashamed to look at it. You have charged me for them at 3s 8d, 4s and 4s 6d and so on, but they are not worth 2s on average. They are nothing but rubbish. However, the cottons and the bays and silk camisoles are good. I note that you put 3 pieces of bays wrapped up in one, but that is not what I ordered. I wanted each piece on its own, and the camisoles among the yellow bays, some in each piece. I was soon able to dispose of them. The three pieces of bays were very heavy and not very well sewn together with strong thread or sail-yarn. In packs 9, 10 and 11 were serges, with which I was also well satisfied, as much with the goods as the packing with three pieces wrapped in one. In pack 12 I was also well pleased with the coloured cloths, and in packs Nos. 13 and 14 I was content with the pieces, although the colours do not match well with each other. All in all, 1am well satisfied with them except with the wretched 40 dozens and 30 pieces of kerseys. You must not buy such commodities in London another time. This is friendly advice to you, with which I commend you to God\u2019s protection.\n[P.S.] The 30 pieces of kersey from Hull were not laid, three pieces in one, according to my orders, instead of each piece on its own. Another time, strict attention must be given to following orders. N.B. On closing this letter I received yours of the 6th of August under Mr Pincier\u2019s cover, from which I see that you have ordered some goods from Hull. In reply, I must say that I would rather not have had them because I will not receive them at the right time. I have already supplied myself with as many dozens and kerscys as I can sell over the winter. I have just seen that the captain has arrived from Hull, but he has no account with him, only the bill of lading and a small freight bill. Farewell.",

    "TEXT": "Your letter of the 8th instant has reached me safely, from which I see that the copper plates I sent aboard Captain Blauwers have been sold to two people who will pay in two and four months time. I had hoped you would sell to the Guinea Company, or to someone else, for cash payment as you always assured me you would in your letters. I would have been much happier to see you had done so, but since you have done otherwise there is no point in changing it. I hope these people are doubly reliable, otherwise I wish you had rather left my goods unsold and waited for a cash-customer. I must content myself with the thought that the transaction will have been a good one if the people turn out to be good. You write of \u201c\u00a35 4s at 4 months\u2019 and \u2018\u00a35 2s at 2 months\u2019. This must be an error, and should be \u00a36, otherwise I would be doing badly and could not approve of the sale. I have seen in other letters from [London] that such plates can fetch \u00a36 4s for cash. Furthermore, I hope you will be satisfied in both cases with 2 per cent commission so that I can enjoy some profit thereby. This will give me some motive for continuing, otherwise I shall have to suspend the trade. Sheet copper at \u00a36 ros is a bad price\u2014with that one can expect no profit but only loss. When, at the existing rate of exchange, one can make \u00a37 sterling I shall send some more. Because I have my own mill I can provide you with a quantity of sheet-copper plates and pots ata fixed price, when I know what assortment sells. Only I would rather trade for payment in cash and would only grant two to three months credit when I can stipulate a good price from reliable people.\n Likewise, I shall also send black latten and white when you can give mea fixed price which you will stand by. It is a commodity which is in demand in [London]. I thank you for honouring my draft of \u00a3150 sterling, because the rate of exchange was such that it might have been refused. In order to enjoy this rate again I am taking the liberty of drawing another \u00a3100 sterling, not doubting that you will honour it with due acceptance. I have loaded 50 pieces of plate in Leonard Bushell for my account, marked \u20ac,. He will be ready to sail in a few days time. With my next letter a bill of lading will follow. I cannot agree with Captain Meerwich, who has already departed, about the freight. I rely on you to treat me like a friend in the matter, and commend you to God\u2019s protection, &c.",

It can happen that one is not at all comfortable at sea, but if it does not last long one can endure it.\n I probably learned more English on the way than during my stay at London as it was my turn to do all the talking. The two other gentlemen did not know enough to order a shoulder of mutton, so I got us a piece of roast beef and besides that enjoyed very fine company. I have spoken to Mr Botte. I think it will be all right; I shall speak with him farther. From Sweden I shall order 400 to 500 slb of pan-iron to be made for the coming year. None has been made this year as the summer has been rather dry. I shall get them to make some in the spring so that we can have some early.\nEnfin le Brandenb[ourg] occupe toute la Pomeranie. Gripswold, Stettin rendu. Ainsi les Swedois hors de calemay apparemment pour quelques peu de temps. De la paix generale ou avec l\u2019empereur [ou] l\u2019espaigne one still cannot rely upon.

    "TEXT": "My last letter was about a week ago. Since then I have received yours of the 8th instant. Ihave received the galls from Cutler, but I have to tell you (although to my regret, for I greatly dislike complaining) that I am astonished you should send me such goods. Ten or twelve of the sacks are passable, although I had hoped for better, but the rest are so extremely bad that I have never had the like in twenty years of trading. It is bad, uncultivated stuff, mostly of bush-galls. If one takes them out of the sack with a ladle[?] or dish* there are no blue galls to be scen underneath but only wild galls. What can I say? It is annoying to be served in such a way. One pays over good money for it yet is obeyed in nothing even though I gave such explicit orders and asked you to send only good, plump, blue galls or else nothing at all, and not to quibble about 6d or 1s more. I do not know how to sell such terrible stuff here, much less can I send it to my friends. I would lose their commissions. I would like to know, what am I to do with these awful galls? If you do not believe me you can tell Mr Ruland or Mr Lethieullier so that they can see them and give you better advice. As I do not seek your harm, I would rather that you did not desire mine. Iam heartily sorry that I have to press this. I still need 6 or 8 sacks of choice quality galls, and to my great annoyance I must buy them from others, which is very painful. God preserve you, &c. \n[P.S.] If the galls were tolerably good, and ifamong the remaining 12 or 14 sacks of bad ones there were still some blue ones to be found or seen, I would not be so annoyed, but there are enough such galls here and one dare not procure them from [England] without great expense and risk. The above-mentioned 10 or 12 sacks are good, although we have had better from the English here. However, there is nothing more to be said: finally one must let it pass\u2014but the remainder are too bad!",

We have found the goods to be correct but are not so well satisfied with the 15 per cent which you have charged on top of the expenses, which in these times we regard as very inappropriate. All the goods which we order from Holland\u2014not only those wares which are sent on credit, but also those which our factor buys for us for cash\u2014are sent directly to us and we are aware of no other expenses apart from those which are customary in Holland. We trust that all goods will be as free in English ships as they are in Dutch, and if they are to be burdened with such large costs we would do better to despatch our returns to Holland and order English goods from there. They would not cost as much as they do on such conditions as you have stipulated for us in the account. Things are very different now from what they were before, with Mr Darbey. Then the English were sole masters and we had to allow them to do as they liked, but now things are different. If you will not treat us reasonably it will oblige us to do business with someone else. Last year Mr William Cooper sent us some goods but was aware of nothing more than ordinary charges. You can take it from this that we will not stand for it, or pay for it. We recently sent you wire, which reached you unhindered; why then cannot our goods come unmolested?\n If you will serve us as a factor and provide us with good insurers every time we will do further business together and order larger amounts than ever before. But if not, we shall have to find another who will serve us in return for his commission. You will send us our account by way of Livland and compile a proper expense account so that we can settle this consignment with one another.

Since then I find myself with your welcome letters of the 6th, 13th, 20th of December and 3rd instant, and have seen thereby that you had not yet received the Barbary almonds which you bought for me, and that you were of the opinion that you ought to delay their receipt for as long as possible. Iam glad of that since we will not be having open water very soon and in the meantime the almonds would suffer rather from the rats, like those on a ship from Barbary which delivered its cargo somewhat damaged. And I note that in this way we may get them cheaper, but I beg you please make sure that you receive nothing but good quality, for bad quality goods are no use to me at any price. Please keep yourself informed if newly arrived goods are sold at lower prices.\n Iam glad that the \u00a385 remitted for your account was accepted. I have received the protest concerning the \u00a3100 on B. Sirps and will know what to do with it. Concerning the \u00a3100 which you have paid for the honour of Lubers, I have debited you for \u00a3100 185 4d. I could have wished that you had returned the bill of exchange together with the second protest, but as you have not done so by now it should not be necessary for us to correspond about it again, and I believe that in future this Lubers will behave himself with more discretion than he has shown towards me.\n Ihave sold your Jamaican tobacco to Hans. P. Dimpfel at 42s per Ib., for cash, payable in bank money. Please make a note of it. With my next letter I shall send you an account. I could not push the price up any higher, and I would rather have taken $s less in bank money than sell it for current money, for the agio on it is 34 per cent and there is uncertainty whether it might not go higher. I have also sold 48 sacks of our scraped ginger which came with Hendrick Weever and delivered them yesterday to Hermann Harvart for 73 g with 85 rebate payable in bank money. The price is rather poor and we shall not gain much by it, butas there is so little demand for it now I did not want to let the opportunity pass. The account of this also will be sent by my next, and if the money has come in a remittance will be made to you. Meanwhile I think we shall also get in the money for our last bale of Ardasse because the debtor has promised it. As for our Bermuda tobacco, with the waters closed I can still find no buyers, but if any opportunity offers itself it will not be neglected. I wait to hear if any nice Virginia-leaf can be had in [England] and at what price and when the ships are expected. I shall inquire how the purchaser fares with your tobacco and keep you informed. As far as I can discover he sends it into Germany in place of another variety. Isce that you have been persuaded to believe that one cannot learn any good German here and as a result have requested your servant! to be sent to some place in Germany where he can better perfect the language. I would gladly see to that if did not believe that it would not be profitable either for you or your servant, for you ought to consider the fact that he will not learn to pronounce the language like a born-German within five years and will be little use to you unless he can write the language correctly, which is what you want him mostly to do, and he can just as well learn to write here as in Germany, for there is no difference; and he is already so far advanced that he can read and understand any book in High German just as well, if not better, than Dutch and also speaks High German, so it only remains for him to learn the style of German letters, which cannot be easily done except in a counting-house. I hope to help him find one, and expect to hear from houses in Niiremberg. If, in answer to this, you persist in your plan I shall arrange it but I consider it unnecessary, for your information. Enclosed herewith is a letter from him which may be useful to you. Regarding your good wishes for the newly-commenced year, I most heartily thank you and pray to God to preserve you, your wife and children in good health and prosper you in every way he can in this and many coming years, which I trust the Lord will do and keep you in his protection, remaining, &c.\n[P.S.] It freezes here unusually hard.",

The best that we have been able to contrive is to arrange for him to go on managing his works and to supply him with a quantity of copper which, in exchange, he returns back again as manufactured brass. The wages for it are deducted from his debt and although this will take a very long time (and also cannot be done without employing a good deal of money) we have decided it is better to deal with it on this basis than to let the debt run on still longer. But we believe there is still nothing that can be done for you as long as you have not settled accounts with Momma and got him to acknowledge the debt, which will only be obtained with difficulty, for according to our observation he will stir up some dispute. In his letter of January the 3rd, which we received yesterday, he complains much that his goods remain for so long unsold in London, being astonished that his kettles and pots have not been sent to us to sell in accordance with the orders which he gave to you last summer, since the proceeds would be made good to you. Having got no answer about this he asks us to write to you to find what reason there is for delay, to which we await your decision. And in case you feel some difficulty, for fear that we shall make our claims on it, we hope it will not inhibit you, assuring you that if they can be sold here the proceeds will be sent to you. With regard to our kettles and pots, we have hitherto not restricted you to any price limit and once again we beg you to make an end of the matter the sooner the better so that the account can be closed. With heartiest regards, we commend you to God and remain, &c.",

And as I had observed in what good esteem you were held by the aforementioned gentlemen and that you were practical and precise in all kinds of trade, I found no difficulty in recommending Mr Andreas Ingolstetter of Niiremberg to address himself to you, who had requested me to find him a reputable and reliable correspondent who would be willing to serve him in the purchase of English tin. He initially wanted to know the varieties and prices of it, and at what cost it could be delivered to him at Bremen, so that he could see if he would find it profitable, and in future wants to send for any other English products suitable for Germany. If you are now inclined to favour him with the raguagly? of tin and other wares I have no doubt that in due course a mutually satisfactory correspondence can be established, especially if the good God grants us a general peace. You can be assured that he is a man of complete reliability, precise and accurate in his affairs, of which I can give you certain testimony as I know him intimately, having lived with him for many years. But in case you do not take my word for it, since you do not know me, he will be able to inform you of enough reliable people who will be able to assure you about his condition. In any case, if you join together in a correspondence his own conduct will give you adequate testimony to his promptitude and reliability. It is a matter of indifference to him whether you correspond with him in Italian, French or Low German, though the Low German will be the best for him as you are not accustomed to writing High German.\n Besides Mr Ingolstetter, I have recommended your person and condition to Mr Willem Grassel at Niiremberg,? who will perhaps write to you about a trial purchase of tin, in which case you would do well to serve him as he is also reputed reliable and is one of the principal persons in the city, though he is not so intimately known to me as Mr Ingolstetter, who makes no fuss about himself but goes about his business quietly and confidently. You can, if you wish, write to them directly in reply when they write to you or, if you judge it necessary, write to me, giving the letters to the ordinary post to be forwarded by Mr Christian Meschman.

I am grateful for your remembrance and your offer of service. I can have no greater satisfaction than the honour of your correspondence and therewith the maintenance of our good friendship. But the times have for so long been so miserable and also so dangerous that one has had enough to do to preserve oneself, without going to all the trouble of trade. But it may be that we shall soon have a general peace (unless it is again transferred to another place, which the Almighty prevent!) by which everyone may recover themselves and trade may begin to improve. May God grant it and allow me the chance of being able to gain and enjoy your correspondence. There is occasionally something to be done with goods from [England], if only consumption were rather better. It has been extremely bad because of the misery throughout Germany, but undoubtedly it will now improve. Meanwhile I shall attend to your advice and make my speculations accordingly, wherever there is a chance of profit. Herewith you will receive one of our price-currents, and from it the news that there is little oil in town, as a result of which it has risen to 75 and 78 RD per pipe of 820 lb. net.

I await your decison and must say further that my brother, Jan Battista, is going through Brabant to Paris without visiting [England] but it could easily happen that he will do so on his return journey.

I once had a bale taken away from me which I only recovered with great trouble and expense. I was also advised that my stockings would be better made at Hamburg than my English white woven stockings, since those of their style have better sales.

    "TEXT": "I did not write to you by the last post\u2014I should say, for several posts\u2014and I find myself meanwhile with your letter of the 11th instant, from which I have seen the prices of sundry goods as well as your opinion about one sort or another, for all of which I thank you. Sales are so small that prices are stifled and are as likely to produce losses as profits, as is the case with those in [London] who have bought pepper from the East India Company, for it cannot be sold here at 124g. It is said that a quantity was sold at 12g, and that is how things are with other goods, as far as one can see, so that one is forced to sit tight. The higher rate of exchange, as you can see at the foot of this letter, also harms commodity prices. Black ginger can be had at 33 to 33g; scraped ditto, 7g; Caribbean indigo of extremely choice quality, 435 with 13 months rebate; Aleppo galls, 47 ML per 100 |b., as before. Whether Turkish or Levant wares will increase in price through the danger from the Turks, time will tell. The bale of Ardasse which you last provided is still lying here unsold. The English have got a quantity, with which they are heavily undercutting the price at 13s, with 103 per cent discount, which is reckoned to have been bought in [London] at 9s. The exchange is at 345 5g and the net charge for insurance is 2 per cent. Although, as you truly say, the price is low, nonetheless there is no profit to be made, which is a miserable state of affairs. Of Zerbassi, Legi and other varieties one can buy here as cheaply as you can offer it in [London]. It is the most delicate stuff that one could ever see, so wonderfully has that trade been driven. If there should be any changes in silk, galls or ginger, please let me know. Please hand the enclosed, undamaged, to Mr Samuel la Motte and procure an answer. I have been asked to obtain it by my friends in Germany and beg you to forgive the trouble. With very friendly regards, may the Lord protect you, &r.",

    "TEXT": "My last letter to you was on the 8th instant. Since then I have received your welcome letter of the r1th ditto, with news of what is going on in trade over there, for which I warmly thank you and refer you to what I said in my previous letter. I firmly believe that there could be something to be done with goods from [England] if only sales were somewhat greater than they have been because of all the miserable unrest in Germany. To all appearances things may soon improve because the peace has been largely settled and there is good hope that God will grant the remainder. We may then look about for something profitable to invest in. Ardasse, if it is choice quality, can fetch 14 to 143s; poor quality can be had for 13 to 133s. Oil remains at the same price still and is selling for RD 80 per pipe, since there is little in town. Indigo guatemalo is at 6s. There are few raisins to be obtained, and I refer you for the rest to the enclosed price-current.!\n I should be glad to know when a convoy is going from [England] to Spain. One of my good friends want to make a journey there and is minded to go by sea from [England]. You will oblige me greatly if you would have the goodness to inform me when there is a chance of a convoy, in time for him to get there from here. He would be glad to see if there was one about the middle of June. I await to hear what there is.\n Further, I must ask you, as a friend, to send me with the earliest ship 400 glass bottles and 500 or 600 cork plugs to close them with as I understand that they are very much cheaper and better than here. I have had some Champagne wine sent to me from France and it can be better preserved therein than in the casks. This may be troublesome for you, but I hope you will not take my sudden requests too badly. I shall gladly serve you in return at any opportunity, and remain, with friendly regards, always, &c.",

Accompanying both was a copy ofa memorandum about various wares, to which I refer you and which I hope you received safely and obeyed before the arrival of this. Your welcome letters from London of the 13th and 20th of December were received, to which this serves as an answer. Concerning the 844 coils of copper-wire, I will let the matter drop until another time. I trust that Mr Hall will pay me what he owes. As regards your 2 per cent commission for the purchase of the manufactures and other wares\u2014if you will buy them for me and insure them for risks from enemies and the sea, I will take them on trial, but I beg you to buy them according to my memorandum and for the least possible expense. I hope you will always do your best for me, and since you can credit yourself with 14 per cent commission I trust that you will do everything possible on my behalf. You will be getting a large amount of commission from me this summer since, at the earliest opportunity, I shall be despatching you returns, shipping everything in your name as ifit were going for your account and risk. I shall write to you beforehand so that you can have everything insured. I have 200 slb of copper at Reenstierna\u2019s works at Norrk\u00e9ping. 74 slb are already made into wire and the rest will follow shortly, all of which I will send to you. I have bought iron from H.F., 1.700 slb, which I shall be getting with the first schuit. But I shall be selling it here, since I hear from [London] as well as Amsterdam that prices are very bad.\n Tawait your account of the 844 coils of wire at the earliest opportunity, and thank you for crediting me with the Slb. 26.8.10 lb.

Since then I have received from London yours of the 12th of November, 13th of December, 28th of February and 15th of March, from which I have seen what is happening in trade. I see that copper-wire prices are very bad. May God forgive Urban Hall ifhe is the cause of it. I hope that before long he will at last pay me what he owes.\n Isee also that you have sold 300 copper blanks, for which Iam glad. I have set the proceeds of \u00a381 3s 4d down to your account. Business in this country is still very bad, particularly because we have had a long, dry winter, which still continues. This spring we have had hardly any rain and the sea has been frozen from the continued cold, which means that all iron and copper works have been at a standstill for lack of water. Iam sure that not half'as much iron has been worked this year as at other times in the past. I have been waiting all spring for 1.000-1.200 slb of iron to come down with the first barge, but so far have had no more than 600 slb, and that is on account of the shortage of water. Although I would wish you to have 2.000 slb it will be rather slow to go now. Likewise, I also have roo slb of copper at Nyk\u00e9ping and 200 slb at Norrk\u00e9ping, which I have ordered to be made into copper-wire, but because of the lack of water it is also delayed for a long time. Meanwhile, there is an English ship lying at Norrk\u00e9ping which will be leaving soon and I shall load on it, consigned to you, as much as is now ready. Otherwise there is nothing special to report and I refer you to my previous letters, commending you to God\u2019s protection, &c.\n[P.S.] My dear Mr David, I hope that your servant, Jacob Fahlgren, will soon be back with you, and that he has done you true and honourable service. I must ask you to be so very kind as to return me my obligation or surety, as a matter of life or death. Here inclosed follows the bill of lading for 393 coils of copper-wire sent with Captain Leonard Bushell. May God bring him in safety.",

    "TEXT": "I have never had the honour of writing to you before. I am doing so now because Mr Hendrick Cletcher handed over to me on the 13th instant a letter of yours, dated the 16th of May, together with a bill of exchange for RD 2.100 drawn on His Excellency Erick Fleming, with orders about what to do if it were not paid. Mr Cletcher gave me the letter because he was about to set off on his journey to his works, as you can see from the accompanying letter from him, to which I refer you. You can be assured that I shall serve you promptly and reasonably. Concerning the bill of exchange, I tried to show it to the acceptant but as he died some weeks ago in the country and as his wife is still there I have had to let the widow know about the bill by letter and, if she is willing to accept the same, have asked her to let one of her friends write to me and assure me that the bill would be promptly paid. If the acceptant asks me to send the bill of exchange I cannot decide whether or not to send the original into the country, but I am keeping to the letter he wrote to me and as long as it is accepted there should be no difficulty. These people want to make it good and I do not doubt that it will be promptly honoured as the widow wants her son to maintain his credit, of which they stand in need. Herewith goes a letter to him which I beg you to forward as soon as possible. He writes that he will pay me in cash. If so I shall await your orders, being at your command at any hour, for at the present there is no chance of remitting to London or Hamburg or Amsterdam at a rate of 24 dollars per \u00a31 sterling, as no one wants to do it on London for less than 27 dollars, nor Hamburg for 26 marks and Amsterdam for 25 marks, so there is nothing to be done, and I can see no prospect of improvement.\n Iron is at 29 or 30 dollars, according to quality, and one can get good iron for 30 dollars and very fine iron for 31 dollars. There is little sign ofany change. Wire is at 280 to 282 dollars and it is thought that it might perhaps rise higher since not so much is being made as last year. There is no pitch or tar for sale as the Company itself has none here to load its own ships with, though things may be better in the summer when moreis likely to come in. If you could send a ship with malt, which now fetches 16 dollars per ton and looks very likely to fetch more by August, and take a return cargo of tar and some wire and iron, you would not do badly. Whatever your order, you can rest assured that it will be promptly attended to as soon as it comes, If there are any other matters in which I can be of service you have only to command. I handle the affairs of Steven de Geer and David van Baerle, who assure me that they are well satisfied, and I am sure you will likewise find it so. For the present there is nothing more except friendly regards, &c.",

Since then I have had yours of the 27th of June, with which you sent me the invoice and bill of lading for 25 sacks of Aleppo galls which you have consigned to me in the ship De Perle, Captain Charles Seyers. If the Lord brings him in safety I shall take possession of the same and put them in a good place in the warehouse and meanwhile await your orders, for you will have seen from my foregoing letter that I have left the proffered galls for your account, and there they can remain. My intention, when I gave the order, was to have some if there was any considerable rise in prices being maintained. You will by now have cancelled my order, and Iam meanwhile waiting to hear what you want to have done with them, and whether you wish them to be bought by me. You can rest assured that your interests will be safeguarded as if they were my own, and that you will find me punctual and prompt in everything, in order to encourage you to entrust me with further commands, I trust that the opportunity will present itself so that we can have more dealings with one another. May God only grant that business will improve! At present there is little demand for galls and things are rather quiet, but I hope that before long things will go better. Meanwhile, the Leipzigers have come, who usually buy a good quantity. I have been now and again offered 47 ML per roo lb., with 13 months rebate, for a quantity of mine, but I have not wanted to sell them since you persuaded me that they would not decline in price. Now, others are selling good quality stuff at 463 ML per 100 |b., but I hope that they will pick up again as soon as there is more demand. This will be governed by the quantity coming from [England], which will be known to you, and if the price is reasonably firm I shall either keep them or dispose of them. I see that pepper has risen in price in [London]. It remains here at 123g per lb., but may well be influenced by that. I still have mine all together in hand, which at first were selling ata loss for 12g. Raisins have been greatly sought after. Please learn what can be expected from [England]. Good quality should sell in handfuls for 30 to 31 ML per 100 |b. If you can send any please do so freely, vizt. choice quality, if you can haggle for it at 12s per Ib. Oil and many other Marseille goods are falling; only capers have newly arrived and are selling in handfuls at 52 ML per 100 |b., with 13 months rebate and a 30 per cent tare. \nFriendly regards, the Lord protect you, &c.",

May God bring him and also Thomas Master in safety as he has with Charles Siers. I have received the ginger which he brought and found the quality reasonably good, so there is no further need to discuss it.\n Iam surprised that many goods are dearer in [England] than here. It seems the English do not want to sell in [London] at a reasonable price but would rather send them here and take less for them than they can get in [England]. This is bad business, but as it seems irremediable one must simply be patient.\n I would have very gladly had some cotton, and I regret that you have been so slow about purchasing it. It is now too dear and the exchange too high for it to come. Enclosed I send a second bill of exchange for \u00a3100 at double usance on Mr William Gore, payable to my order. Please procure its acceptance and keep it by you until further order. You have bought for my account about 4.000 Ib. of Bermuda tobacco at sd [per Ib.] on the condition that you paid for the barrels and the costs of packing. Put that down to me, although I fear that the expenses will be very great and may easily amount to 4d [per lb.], as the subsequent account will probably show. If you cannot achieve anything with regard to the commission for Barbados indigo please buy about 50 sacks of white, scraped ginger at 30s [per cwt.], but the quality must be as fine as the last lot, otherwise it is no use to me. Please despatch it as quickly as possible, and let me know if you succeed. And if you can obtain good Barbados sugar at 213 \u2014213 shillings, free on board, please buy me 10 or 12 butts and send them here. You can draw on me for the cost at double usance, as advantageously as possible, and your bills of exchange will be duly honoured.\n The English earth* about which I have written to you before is a kind which is used by the silk-weavers if they want to weave the silk in a hard colour\u2014thatis to say, not liable to wash off\u2014which, by the action of the earth becomes suppler, since it contains a secret which is unknown to most people, and those that know it will not reveal it to others. I would like you to ask for such an earth from a weaver, but do not let it appear that it is to be used for weaving for then he could see what kind it is and learn its use.

Iconfirm my order about buying for me 25 bales of pepper, and I must now wait to hear at what price you have obtained them. You will have seen from my preceding letter that I have punctually honoured your bill of exchange for \u00a3200 and set against it a bill for \u00a3200 at 34s 11g for which you have been credited with 2.618.12 ML. The said amount is remitted for my account and can serve for the pepper.\n I have just now seen ina letter to Mr Ruland the prices which have been set by the [English East India] Company on one commodity and another, I greatly wish I might have known this eight days earlier so that I could have rushed off an order, since not much cardamon was sold. Ihad imagined that the price would have been higher, but 3s per lb. is quite reasonable. I wish I had commissioned it together with my preceding order, but if the Company has not raised it much higher than it is now, and if you can obtain it in one way or another so that it will yield a little profit, I would gladly have 500 to 600 Ib. I should also be glad to have ro or 15 pots of preserved ginger, as a trial, at the least price obtainable. But please buy nothing other than good quality and look after my interests as if they were your own. For your reimbursement please draw the total on me for payment at the beginning of next month and your bills will be punctually honoured. I could have remitted to you today for 35s, at sight, but I find that I have already disposed of my balance and can only take in bills at the beginning of next month at the earliest, on which you may rely. If you cannot obtain fine quality ginger at 14s I shall be glad to hear by return of post since I shall then given an alternative order and make a remittance. I shall also be glad to learn, in reply to this, what prospect you see concerning the cardamon. Yesterday I had a buyer for two sacks of galls [that with]? the same took one sack of mine, which satisfied him well, so one must let him have his way. One of your sacks of galls was also sold to Hans Ellers for 463 ML per 100 Ib. at 13 months discount, and this morning a weaver has promised to come and fetch a sack. I shall dispose of them as best I can, but I wish I could find just one buyer for your galls. If he would take the whole batch I would be glad to lower the price. One must wait for an opportunity, and I shall allow no chance to slip by. You can be assured that I shall do my duty, but one cannot always sell as one wants to here, and I notice that others are unable to sell anything, or have sold anything since the Leipzigers went away.

I shall now wait and see how much there will be for the coming year and take care that the lengths of the thick bars are not uneven but trimmed off, as some have been. I now have before me your letter of July the 11th. Cletscher is not here but is expected soon and we shall then discuss your affairs. Young Momma is here, telling everyone of the wrong you do them. The only thing I had to say is that the objections to paying were quite ordinary ones et que j\u2019en estois autrement inform\u00e9, and that Mr Cletscher had since got orders to see what could be done, mais je vous diray bien mon sentiment, the gentleman is so much behindhand that there is nothing to be got from him. J\u2019auray soin de vostre interest, mais vous ne ferez pas mall de donner vos ordres un peu amplement a Mr Cletscher if you want to reach a settlement.\n The exchange on Amsterdam is high here, at about 26 dollars, et fort peu de bonne lettres. There is not much iron in stock: all the works are at a standstill for lack of water and abroad there are no sales. The English come here with salt to lade tar. There is little pitch and now little tar also, but more is likely to come. Botte aura fait un movais coup. Without the pitch we would have difficulty in finding the running capital, in my opinion. Mr Wouters? has bought for you a quantity of \u2018O\u2019 iron at 31 dollars and given 32 for *@. This is to make up for the exchange rate. There are now four English ships here which will have difficulty in obtaining any freight or cargo if no tar arrives, because there is not as much iron in town as they need for their lading.\n Voyla la pais conclus entre les Rois du Nort! I hope that matters will now go rather better. La sell se vent a 133 dollars now, and ifan English ship had not arrived with some it would have risen. There is still one more expected, et puis les vesseaux holandois are somewhat delayed, it may well rise again.\n There is little copper in stock. It has all been coined and stands at 290 dollars. Wire can be got at 270 to 272 dollars.\n Abraham Cronstr\u00e9m is expected in town any day. I shall then obtain his power of attorney and send it, but he behaves as if evite de rencontrer Momma, for he will then be perplexed and not know what to say.

By the next conveyance I shall remitt you farther returnes. Of the arryval of the vessel from Dunkerk I have acquainted you, and pray God send those safe from Holland. Your goods by them I shal dispose of by all good oppertunityes and take the best care I can possible to prevent bad debts. The account of your bayes is sent you, and I shal make you the returnes of there proceed exactly as you order, although I have seen noe such order before. That commodity I hear is now fallen againe at home and wil doubtlesse yet considerably more. If you would be concerned in any wools, some Colchester bayes, barraganen, cloves and cinamont would buy the best and accompts might be soone cleered and yeald as much profitt as otherwyse. In Rouen they sel best at present. Here are also good \u2018quantetyes of Russia hides sold and its a staple commodity, but the benefitt might be by haveing them cheape bought in. The exchange for Holland, etc, is now verry advantagious to have any goods provided there. Your pepper cost dear and therefore rendred the worse. Mr Christopher sent me some Bellepatam which cost 8 per cent cheaper. If you send halfe of that and halfe Jambe, the one may help off the other and both yeald as much as the best alone. I shall pay Mr Anckeman the 200 pieces of eight you order and serve him in what else I can, which is all at present, but I remaine, Sir, your humble servant, &c.\u2019 \n458 D. GEYSMER to JD\nIhave received your welcome letter of the 12th instant. Iam glad that you have accepted my bill for \u00a3200 and made a note of it. [also see that you have, according to my order, bought 25 sacks of pepper at 73d [per lb.] and I have noted how you have loaded it. In order to enjoy the full discount you had better receive it and pay for it, for which I thank you warmly. I shall gladly make good to you interest for the time during which you must have been out of pocket, which you have only to inform me of, and I shall nonetheless remain obliged for your kindness.\n Isee that all the cardamon has been bought up and that no more is to be expected. I must therefore wait and see what kind of preserved ginger you have bought for me; and I will learn in due course whether you have been able to perform my order concering white ginger. Meanwhile, thank you for news of what prices are being fetched by one thing or another. Concerning your galls, you will have seen how much of them has been sold. Since then I have achieved nothing more, but I continue to do my best, hoping that as the Leipziger fair approaches they may be more sought after. If any good opportunity arises I shall not let it slip, and you will share in anything I achieve. You can expect to receive promptly any profits that are obtained.\n People here are getting rather suspicious about the Danes, as it is said that their King is coming this way with many men and that ten Danish warships are coming to the Elbe. [hope it is not so. If this arrives in time and the captain is still at [London] with my 25 sacks of pepper, please put down in the bill of lading that they are for the account and at the risk of Mr Adrian Ruland of Amsterdam, so that they can go in peace. However, I do not believe that they will dare to inspect English ships in any event. May God grant us peace, in whose holy protection I commend you, with friendly regards.\n[P.S.] If, on receipt of this the white, and also the preserved, ginger are not yet bought, please do not buy any for me but let it rest until further order. I shall meanwhile see how things develop between the Danes and this city. If you have got my balance in hand you can remit it here in reliable bills as advantageously as possible at double usance. Here enclosed is the second copy of the \u00a3150 bill of exchange, recently endorsed. Please make use of it. Adieu. Thank you for the enclosed price-current, but it is not necessary to send it to me. Mr Ruland obtains plenty of them and he can supply me adequately.",

The amount which was to be had for \u00a3100 has already been ordered. I have never despatched any Brabant goods by way of Dunkirk before but if the costs are more reasonable than they are from here I shall see to it. This is a free port for the export of Brabant goods, so the duty only has to be paid on export from Brabant and on import here. There is going to be a convoy departing from here for Bilbao between the 2oth and asth of this month, and I believe in Middelburg I shall have the best opportunity of handling things for you as if for myself. I have procured acceptance of your four bills of exchange and I shall keep them by me as you ordered, awaiting your commands for our East India Company sale. No one knows when it will be but one of our returning ships is now in harbour and the enclosed will tell you more fully about the cargo, for your consideration. An unusually large amount of copper is coming from Japan, as a result of which copper has fallen considerably here. There is also a great quantity of silk.\n I confirm again that you, or others, would do very well to remit now any money that is needed over here, now your Company has had its sale, for the frenzy of drafts will lower the exchange rate. Money will be needed when we have our sale and there is likely to be plenty of money coming to [London] from Cadiz, which should also find its way here. I have no doubt that anyone who understands your trade will know how to extract some profit from this. There is much going to Sweden. If there is anything here which might be useful to you, or any goods which can be brought from there, any purchase of cloths or otherwise, be pleased to command, I intend you to take satisfaction in my management, and you can easily experiment with a small trial-order. But as regards salt, a great deal has been sent from these parts. The ships are chartered for St Ubes and from there go direct to Sweden. While writing this I have received letters from Ghent saying that linen has risen but in three or four weeks will fall again. Meanwhile my friend will risk finding out what can be done.\nWith greetings from, A.D. [P.S.] Our ships departing for Bilbao call in at your [Isle of] Wight. The bills of exchange are all accepted.",

Since then I have received your letter of the 11th of July which reached me yesterday together with various enclosures which have all been duly forwarded. I gave De Geer his personally. You will have learned from my previous letter that I have received the RD 2.100. Inow see your order about how you want it employed. No one knows how the exchange goes, according to Mr Jacob Fahlgreen, or whether it will continue. It is just not possible to remit good bills of exchange for [London] at the moment for 25 dollars, or to Hamburg, or to Amsterdam. The reason is that bills on London can fetch 28 dollars, on Hamburg 26: to }, and on Amsterdam 254 to 26 marks, so there is nothing to be done. i It is difficult to spend anything on pitch or tar. There is scarcely any pitch and little tar in stock, so that whoever takes it gets bad stuff for 130 dollars. I hear that it scarcely fetches \u00a37 in [London], so that also must be passed over. As for orgronts iron, such as \u2018OO\u2019 or *@\u2019, the latter is not obtainable but I have ordered as much of the \u2018OO\u2019 as your funds here with me extend to for 31 dollars, which the other English here would have gladly taken but I obtained the preference. \u2018G\u2019 is to be had, but not for less than 32 dollars. It is in Claes Wilkens\u2019s hands and he has sold it to various Englishmen at 32 dollars, so I hope you will be content with this amount. About 200 slb will be shipped tomorrow morning with Captain William Norham, an Englishman, for [London]. I have agreed the freight at \u00a32, or forty shillings, per last. I shall consign it to you and give orders to Jan van Deurs at the Sound that he draws the Sound toll on you. This serves to inform you in case you find it necessary to order some insurance. The rest of the iron is expected from the works in eight days. I shall then ship it as quickly as possible and let you know when it is done. There is no square iron nor yet broad iron, but some voyage iron. As soon as the bill of lading is signed it will be sent to you. You would do well if you could send some English malt. There is none in stock here, little is expected and a great demand is approaching. But, above all, the malt must be choice, which I believe could easily fetch 19 or 20 dollars. You cannot fail to make a profit.",

    "TEXT": "I have not had any of your letters for a long while, which occasions the brevity of this. Because of the cheap freight-rates to [England] in free English shipping I have decided to send you a quantity of iron for my own account, asa trial. It will consist of orgronts iron, up to 800 slb of ordinary plate \u2018G\u2019 iron, and about 450 slb of schampeleon and other sorts of 4 YY \u201ciron. It has been distributed and loaded in the following three ships, each with about the same amount\u2014in the ship called the Providence of London, of which Ralph Johnson is captain; in the ship Industry of London, captain Henry Collins, and also in the ship named John of Yarmouth, captain John Allen. And because they will be sailing in the autumn I dare not take any risks, so I must ask you to be so kind as to have them insured against all risks by good and reliable insurers, each of them for RD 2.200, which for all three ships amounts to RD 6.600. You need have no doubts about the shipment being made, God willing, and you have only to ask Mr Urban Hall and other friends who used to live here about me to be satisfactorily informed. The freight rate has been agreed at 30 shillings per last of 15 shippounds, and in the bill of lading it has been stated that it has been shipped by me for your account and risk, so will you please write accordingly to Jean van Deurs at Elsinore in order that he can lay out the toll-money for you and draw it on you. If the dear Lord will give us a secure peace I will send you a good quantity each year, provided that I find it worth my while. For I must be served by you on reasonable terms, in controlling the expenses and taking care to whom you sell, though I cannot tie you down to any fixed price. I also hope you will be satisfied with a 13 per cent commission and an allowance of 4 per cent on any advance of money you may make on receipt of the bills of lading. In your reply I shall expect to learn how much you will permit me to draw on you from Hamburg, and please mention in it what your friend is called and commend to him the honour of my bills of exchange. If you insist on asking for a higher rate of interest I shall have to submit to it patiently until the goods are sold, although the bad prices which I am advised there are in [England] will not bear any high interest charges.\n If there is still a lot of pitch and tar for Mr Botte\u2019s account lying on your hands unsold, please keep me informed about it, because I also have some interest in it. But do not mention it to him or let him know that I have sent you any goods on my account. He has no share in it. The news is that there is no tar nor pitch here in town, and the English ships lying here are unable to get any, which is the reason why they have to take the iron for such a cheap freight. One cannot expect any tar before the month of October, but iron is fetching reasonably good prices here. With friendly regards, &c.\n[P.S.] If in the coming year, you would like to contract for the pitch and tar coming to England so that it can all be held in one hand I shall be glad to help you in preference to others, but it is necessary that you have a capable man of English nationality living here who can defend the contract for you against the resident English, and when you have a ship here he can run along to the authorities and obtain permission for it to export something in one way or another. A last of tar, of 13 barrels, is 130 copper dollars free on board, which according to the current rate of exchange is about 20 to 21 rixdollars; and a last of pitch, of 12 barrels per last, can be had for 212 dollars, or 33 to 34 rixdollars, according to the rate of exchange, which may serve to inform you.

You will oblige me if you can recover what you have disbursed for me from the remittances and I will provide you with an appropriate rate of interest as long as this damaging rate of exchange continues. I have been unable to achieve anything in the sale of our remaining bale of Ardasse, nor likewise with our Bermuda tobacco. Since I fear that things will go badly for this commodity I am going to barter it for Jawers linen, if any opportunity offers, and send it to [England], which I hope you will not oppose.

I have sould 2 parcells of cinamon which have produced well, and cloves, but cloves are the currentest comodity if they can be had reasonable, as I believe they may, the Dutch East India ships beeing, I heare, arrived at Holland. Of the barragans I have sould 26 pieces and shall put off the rest by all occasions. The Dutch ships from Holland beeing, as its said, arrived at San Antono, may bringe your others. My last carryed you invoy|cles and bills of loading of what consigned you by Steele and Roch, who sayled with the convoy and I hope are now at home. J shall hasten more returns also. Your San Sebastian bill my friend hath about 8.000 R. pta.-worth of goods on for security and is provyding to prosecute the carryer\u2019s estate if he will not comply. I hope nothing will be lost there, nor shall I sell any of your good[s] without dew consideracon to whome it is. To aske any consideracon for security of all debtes Iam unwillinge because the proffits are so small now adays that it will not admitt of any extraordinary charge. I shall however have the same care as the goods weare my owne. I knowe not of any such losse you have as yet, your wheat beeing sould to poore people is the reason its so tediously paid for. However I shall endeavour to putt an end thereto speedily, or prosecute the partys. Colchester bays are at present the best comodity from London. I have sould neare 50 balles by these ships and they yeald no badd account, As they are deare at home they keep up here. White bays are also in demand. I kisse your hands and remayne, Sir, your humble servant.",

    "TEXT": "My last letter was on the [blank], since which I have heard nothing from you. Nevertheless, I am writing to tell you how things stand with the Mommas. The old man is at Nyk\u00e9ping and the young man is here, but there is nothing to be done with them. They are stiff-necked and refuse to listen to reason. The one living here is usually drunk everyday from the morning onwards. Enfin, in my opinion, if one proceeds against them one will be only throwing good money after bad.\n Ishall see if something can be arranged with Mr Cletscher about the interested parties, but it will not be easy. Also a salt licence will first have to be obtained. This gentleman is no commission-agent and he concerns himself only with his own affairs, au reste, honnete homme.\n I long to get your letters and my wine, which is taking a long time. Otherwise it will be too late, for we shall be in the depths of winter before the two voyages can reach the inland sea. At the earliest opportunity please let me know your opinion about the pan iron and how much one might have made for the coming year. I shall give orders for the rough ends to be cut off and, to make it lighter, I shall make use of the old pig-iron which is very good. Send me a note about it, because they have asked to know how much they should make of each sort.\n There is also some \u2018G\u2019 iron available which turns out a little harder than the other sort, and as it comes from good iron we use it here for hooping heavy wheels as we find it stronger and more durable than the other kind. If 1 knew the breadth which is most often required in England for binding wagon-wheels I would have one or two sorts made as an experiment. Please send me a note about it, but leave the memorandum open so that Westhuysen? can send me a duplicate.\n Overseas iron prices are low, and over here most works have made only two-thirds of the amount they made last year because of the lack of water. As a result, I cannot send you any ordinary \u2018G\u2019 sheet-iron, though I hope it will be possible to do so next year. Let me also know about \u2018OO\u2019 iron and how suitable it is, as well as the (@y- of which Mr Wilkens has sent you a quantity this year. Also, let me know if the \u2018OO\u2019 square-iron should be of 1 inch, 1} inch and 14 inch as well as 13 inches, and how much of each sort would be best. As I am afraid that the ships which are now lying here loading up may not get away in time, and as I have to make some payments at Amsterdam in December, I shall have to ask you to accommodate me with three or four hundred pounds which Westhuysen could draw upon you for me, or else you could remit it to him. I shall be glad ifit can be done, but please let Amsterdam know how it would suit you best. It will only be for a little while and Westhuysen will let you know whether he will need it in December or February. Thad written as far as this when your letter of the 26th of September arrived. I see that the ships have come and note the amount of pan iron that is required for next year. I shall have it made, in the same assortment as before, and will make sure that it is done properly in order to encourage the customers, though in your last letter you wrote that I was not to make the thickest sort or, at least, not as they were now made because the ends were not even, but I should now be able to supply them.\n IfI pass through Nyk\u00e9ping I shall see if I can speak with the elder Momma. The dispute is making no progress, et doit plus qu\u2019il n\u2019a de bien.\n Iron seems to be very dear here, but the exchange on Amsterdam is reckoned at 26 marks per dollar, and as the return freight-rates to London are not dear this year it has been possible to send it.\n Concerning copper-wire, I have told Mr Wouters to inform you how things stand as he is \nbest acquanited with it. I cannot judge whether one can deal safely with him. Pour moy je na fay difficulte de lesser de mes effaits entre ces mains et je le trouve vigilent et qu'il pren bien garde a ces affaires. Je souhaite toute sorte de prosperite aux nouveaux maries? comme aussi a Madame leur mere, et vous aussi Monsieur son pere (alias step-father). Quand vos vesseau sera venu, qui sans doute sera bien tost, nous aurons soin de nous resouvenir de leur sante, le saison en estant fort propre, car on se pourmene bravement sur les glaces!

    "TEXT": "Today is the rst of November and the above, of the 8th of September, is a copy of my last letter. am sure that it has reached you safely as well as the despatched 235 slb [of iron] since the ship passed through the Sound a long while ago. For the rest, I refer you to my letter. Since then I have received your letters of the sth and 19th of September, which I should have answered earlier but I have been hoping every day that the iron would arrive and that I would be able to send you the bill of lading. 1am extremely annoyed that it is taking so long and my Lord De Geer can be my witness that it is no fault of mine, as the wind has always been so contrary that nothing has been able to come from the works. For six weeks [the iron] has been lying in the barge, somewhere between the works and this city. Secondly, letters have been held up. We have been hoping every week that the posts would go again since peace was concluded, but they have been held back until now, so that it is only with this post that one can make a start with the correspondence, since the normal post is leaving. In my last letter I wrote to you that I had debited you 8.293 dollars and 15 Gre for the 235 slb of iron, but in making a record of it I find that I have made an error amounting to I dollar 16 6re copper money. In reckoning the Slb. 235.13 of iron @ 31 dollars I had put it down as 7.303 dollars 20 dre, but the total ought really to be 7.305 and 4 6re, so that your net debit on the account of iron stands at 8.294 dollars and 31 Gre, which you will please note and forgive the mistake.\n Herewith is the bill of lading for the remaining quantity of Slb. 162.4.10 Ib. of iron despatched to you aboard Captain Hans Kroger. I have procured a somewhat lower freightrate, but it will have to pay rather more toll since the ship is entirely without a free pass. It can be bought for half dollar or something, so your iron is not too heavily burdened, and I will take care of it as if it were for myself. The last one, in which the 235 slb was shipped, had partial freedom and I paid for the rest so that it got total freedom, but this ship has absolutely no freedom so something must be paid which we recover through the freight-rate, as we have cheaper freight than before. When the duty is paid an account will be sent to you. The shipment will be ready to depart in a few days. He is mostly loaded with tar for the owner\u2019s account.\n Hendrick Cletcher has transferred to me your power of attorney and other documents concerning Willem Momma at Nyk\u00e9ping and asked me to pursue the matter so that it can be brought to a conclusion. He further says that you gave him instructions to make me such a request. In fact, you have written nothing to me about it, and it is also a very troublesome commission which looks like being a thankless task, but out of regard for you and at the persuasion of Mr Cletcher and also of De Geer I have undertaken it and had your power of attorney translated into German and have served it on him, requiring him to answer to me about the account. The son, Isaac Momma, who is here, has answered me in place of his father, who is in Nyk\u00e9ping. He says he will send the copy of the power of attorney to his father and let me know the answer. He was sure that his father would not allow him to come to any agreement or compromise until, or before, you debited him in his father\u2019s account with the RD 2.000 which you once wrote (to the said Momma) that you had paid to De Geer, but he would let me know his father\u2019s answer. Steven de Geer has refuted all this to him, but it seems that there is little happening, so it is now necessary to learn from you what you want ordered to be done about it if he will not agree to reason, and how much you will allow me to deduct from the account, or what else you will concede. I beg you to let me know a little about your views of the matter. I shall know how to manage things properly and will try to do the best that is possible for you. The sooner the case is settled the better, for at the moment there is something to be hoped for but later there may not perhaps be so much. I look forward to learning what you have ordered and will govern myself accordingly.\n Isee that the ships will be ready to depart at the earliest in mid-October, so we shall begin to get ready for them. It is to be wished that they come soon, with salt selling at 17 dollars. I was selling all mine at 18 dollars, but since the arrival of two Dutch ships and one English it has been running at 17 dollars and as we are selling it daily we hope the price will continue so, since nothing more is expected from Holland, where it is very dear and selling at \u00a364 [flem.]. Malt, ifit is good, will also fetch a lot of money since there is little English malt in stock here. If God grants its arrival I shall take care of your interests as if they were my own, on that you can rely.\n Isee that in [England] our Swedish wares are very cheap, while here they remain dear. As I wrote previously, iron is at 31 to 32 dollars, according to its quality, and there is not much in stock. Pitch and tar are as before. There is little tar here, though one can obtain something at the previous price. The Company is sending nothing to Holland as there are sufficient stocks there. Letters from Holland say that the commercial treaty between this Crown and Holland has been concluded.! We have not been able to learn the main points yet, but it is not doubted that the Company will come to an end, of which you in [England] will have earlier news than us.\n Although copper prices have dropped so much in Holland, with plenty coming from the East Indies, it still remains dear here and is still selling at 245 dollars. On the exchange it is 260 dollars and it is the same with copper-wire which is still at 275 dollars, and none selling for less. But the demand is also very bad and there is none to sell. Here in town there are about 200 slb in stock. A similar amount is expected but there is no one to buy it. The English have absolutely no desire for it, and in the last two months not more than 80 slb have been sent to [England], vizt. 70 slb in the month of September and ro slb in the month of October, which is very little, and one hears nothing so far that any of it has been sold. If I intend to do anything I shall let you know. Now that we have got water all the works are in full production, but little will come oft this year. Most of the wire is sent to Holland and France, and most of it to the latter. With this I must close, with regards, &c.",

Although the price is very low one must sell as one can, following the market. However, concerning what you wrote previously about a quantity of the \u00a9 [iron] reaching you, I think you will find, as has been found here, that the \u2018O\u2019 iron sells for 4 or 5 per cent more than the \u2018(LY I wrote to you previously to say that 500 slb of \u2018O\u2019 iron was selling at Stockholm and that I presumed it would be sent to London, but I am now informed in letters of the 8th of November that the English only bought 200 slb and the rest is being sent to Hamburg. You will please deal with my iron as if it were for yourself. I have ordered the square \u2018O\u2019 iron to be made so that it can be sent to you in the spring, as it was before, but as for the sheet iron of 33 and 35 inches thick I have not ordered it because it would be too thick, and thus unsaleable. Instead I have ordered them to make the sheets of the usual breadths but as light as possible. However, in reply please send me a paper showing the thickness and breadth [you require] so that I can judge whether it can be made, for I have been an iron-master for over $4 years.\n Regarding the voyage iron for Genoa!\u2014we get it made inland, from Luxemburg and Germany and could easily deliver it here to the agent for 76 and 78 guilders per ton, ina large quantity.

Cinnamon, as you say, sould to deare in Holland to turne to account here, but by the clovs I hope you will make a better businesse. Wax beeing so cheape in London, here\u2019s a good quantitie come. I suppose you finde it comes cheaper thence then it can be had in England. Of the barragans I have sould about 4.and shall putt of the rest by all occasions. Mr Duquesnoy writes me they are fallen at Vallencia, but I observe the exchange is also lower for London which may make them as deare to you. If you find it otherwyse and that the pryse is considerably lower that they may be sent with more conveniency, they are a sound comodity, but pray order him to keep to their goodnesse for others send better goods. All goods there as well as in England are gencrally provyded on better tearmes in the winter, and the spring here I find the best time for sale. Hose of Tournoy are here a current comodity and many sell. I cannot tell what account they may produce, haveing never sould any. He is acquanted with the sort propper, and I have sent Sir John a muster of picotes, which he hath sent Duquesnoy. Is a comodity hath good vent here, if they can be had at about 12 reals per piece, as they might lately; also pelos de camelo, the broader sort, which are worth here 43 to 5 R. pta. per vare as in goodnesse, but these goods must be bought in when cheape and the exchange favourable to turne to account. Of the pepper I had sould 12 baggs at 44 R. vn ere till had any news\u2019twas risen in England and Holland. The rest I hope to putt of at a better rate, but your tarre I feare will yeald but a slender account, here beeinge a good parcell more arrived and the consumption of that comodity here is but litle. I shall make the most of it I can. Sir John advyseth mee of 12 balls of Russia hydes he hath loaden in Roch, 4 for your account. I shall sell them for the most they will yeald and hope there may be reasonable advantage thereby. Bays, I observe, weare risen at home to 22d per ell. Its not impossible but they may keepe up, the flota gocing for the Indies in June and the Galleons in September or October next. It would be amisse to buy them deare if they should fall and be brought cheaper, but if they fall not at home I am perswaded they will ryse proportionable here, as they have donne for some monethes and seaverall accounts I have lately sent home of them have yealded well. Here are moreover few in towne, and if they fall not at home I beleeve verry few will be sent, for your government. In the spring and summer that\u2019s a comodity goes presently offe and lesse proffit may satisfie then by other goods which ly by long and sell to worse paymasters, as pressillias whereof I have some of Sir John\u2019s I cannot sell. I never writt for them. If you order any more baragans or any other Flaunders good let them come by way of Dunckerke. Ther\u2019s lesse charge on them and they come free of the danger of Turkes. I observe Mr Duquesnoy\u2019s intention was to have some of the goods consigned to another. I thinck he hath litle reason, for yours weare I suppose provyded by him by my meanes. I thanck your friendship, as I have more than a treble obligation in what soever I can serve you I will with a particuler sense and reallity.

You have now ordered that, if the money has been paid, I should lay it out this winter on some good sorts of iron from reliable people. In reply, I must say in a friendly way that I cannot exactly follow your order for the reason that the money only falls due at the end of January and February, and then there is no iron to be obtained; and if there is any to be obtained now it must be by means of money\u2014but that is not due yet. Now, for the space ofa week or a fortnight, is a rest-period when those with money travel up-country to provide the works with everything they need, such as coal and ore which is used in the making of iron. However, as it is up to me to take care of your interests so that your money is not lying idle, and in order that you should profit from the low price of iron, I sent to a person two days ago, who was on the point of selling to another but gave me preference, and agreed with him for 400 slb of iron, of which 200 slb will be ordinary sheet-iron, 100 slb broad, schampelion iron and roo slb square iron, to deliver here in Stockholm with the first open water at 27 dollars [per slb]. He takes over the bills of exchange and will discount them or negotiate them as best he can, though I remain liable for any failure of payment.\n The iron is of good material which has been always sent, year after year, to one Mr Strodder! in England. The works once belonged to Utterclo? and its mark is \u2018XX\u2019 but the works have now been sold to another and it is with him that I have contracted, and I am assured that we will be well treated. Mr Strodder, the English merchant, gave 30 dollars for iron last year. There are 200 slb lying ready at the works which I can have immediately. But it is a pity that you did not write how broad the schampelion should be. It has been ordered in various breadths. Please let me know at once in answer to this so it can reach me in time. Thave no doubt that you will be well satisfied with this business, but orgronds iron was not to be obtained. For the 400 slb at 27 dollars you owe me 10.800 dollars, against which we can set the bills of exchange unless their payment fails, which I trust it will not. Ifit should please you to place this order as it suits you (for this consignment will not be disadvantageous for you) I shall be able to help you with further amounts. You can be assured of my promptitude and reliability and that I will take care of your interests as if they were my own. God protect you, &c.",

Until now I have deferred my answer because this city has been troubled by war concerning some differences between the Elector of Brandenburg and the King of Denmark, but they were all settled some weeks ago. After that, winter descended and although we have had little frost and the waters remain navigable the damaging west wind has lasted for three weeks and has gathered a great number of ships here. There are at least 350, large vessels as well as small, among which are 100 laden with oats destined for France, but the west wind keeps them all in, which is very vexing. However, since they will be going in the spring we must hope for an improvement in our lives and that trade will go rather more briskly. Meanwhile, thank you for the prices of sundry goods as well as your opinions on one thing or another. I beg you to continue sending them occasionally as well as news ifany changes occur in the following commodities, such as silk, pepper, ginger and gall-nuts. I might well ask for some of the latter if fine quality can be obtained and the price is not too high. I await your opinion on the matter. The ship of which you were thinking, which came here \u2018adritura\u2019 with 200 sacks, brought only poor, small stuff which will not sell. Two or four sacks were sold for about 43 ML [per 100 |b.] but good quality can fetch as much as 46 or 47 ML. Ardasse silk sells for 13s with the customary rebate; pepper, 132.9; white, scraped ginger, 7g; ditto, black or brown ginger, 45 to 4 or 43 g, and so far there is for all commodities very poor sales. It isa good thing that you received from Mr James Banks the \u00a3134 115 10d remitted and made good the proceeds to Mr John Wigget. I have so far had no letter of news from him, but since it concerns him or his friend Edmont Waaff I suppose it is not necessary. With very friendly regards, the Lord protect you, I remain, &c.",

Since then I have received your welcome letter of the 2oth instant, and with it your extensive news of what has been happening to one commodity or another in [London]. Since goods there are nearly all dearer than here it seems that the trade between here and there must perish, for over there they are maintained at high prices and are sent over here by the owners but as soon as they arrive they are sold for what they will fetch, which is ruining trade. Barbary almonds are sold here thus, which because they can be freely brought to [London] can be profitably sent here at 40s. Silk is also sold here for poor prices, so that I cannot make up my mind to invest 9s [per lb.] for them in [London]. It will have to wait until next May, when probably quite enough will arrive. I do not believe that the currants which have been sent here will do very well, for a good quantity are expected to come here addrittura. That the East India Company is holding a sale on the 9th of March I have noted, and when I receive the details I shall at once consider them and if I decide on any purchases I shall let you know. Sugars have little demand here at present and I cannot decide on enlarging my price limit. I have also seen letters from others in which they advise that good quality [sugar] could be had for 20s or 20s 6d, free on board. Please see if you could not obtain some for less from someone in need of cash, though it must be of good quality, otherwise my balance may as well as lie in London.\n Enclosed herewith I am sending a note about the weights of the 10 hogsheads of Jamaican sugar. Please show it to the man who sold them to youso that he can see what is lacking. The weights are only of the casks, from which 3 per cent was deducted here, and a hundredweight in [England] must yield 104 Ib. here. Captain Lomax brought all his crew ashore in order to take oath, but I did not want that since I would then have had to pay all the expenses here, and I did not know if I could obtain anything in [London]. Now Lomax is no longer here and iris too late for his people to swear. Since you still have the seller in hand he will have to be satisfied with the note, though ifhe will not believe honourable people I shall send him a notarial deed, provided that he pays the expenses. If, in addition, I could send you the testimony of the crew it would already have been sent to you. I urge you to take care of my interests as if they were your own.\n Enclosed I send you the account of the remaining Bermuda tobacco, of which your promised half is \u00a369 8s og, for which I shall give you credit if the money is paid in. Please check the account, and if you find no mistakes, please make a record of it. I also remit you herewith, for your account, \u00a3100 at double usance in a bill of Jan & H. Louis drawn on Pickering & Robinson. Please procure the necessary and credit me with \u00a3171 135 4g at 34s 4g [per \u00a31 sterling]. The second copy of the bill for 500 ducats is not yet here; it will be sent to you later. Please send my current account as soon as possible. With cordial regards, &c.\n[P.S.] Ifyou cannot effect my commission for sugar but can obtain good campeachy-wood at 9s, free on board, please buy me another 200 cwt. and send with another captain for the least possible freight, though if the sugar has been bought buy no campeachy-wood.

This has prevented the journey which I was planning to take to Nyk\u00e9ping, so I have been unable to do anything about your suit with Momma. With Mr Cletscher things stand as before, for he will not waive any of the interest since the debt is too great, though about the salt-licence he is not doing much good. There too there is some good reason for it, but it has been caused by his own fault. I have told him it is cheap, and as soon as the repayment comes in from others I shall settle it in order to close the account. Tam glad that the pan-iron was found to be so good. That which is now being made will be done in the same way, and the coarseness removed from it. It is not feasible to make the 3-inch sheet-iron only $-inch thick. It would bend about, for even the smallest iron cannot be made 4-inch thick, but I shall have it forged as thin as possible. Let me know at once if more will be paid for it than for the \u2018OO\u2019 or the \u2018\u00a9, for it must sell for more, otherwise it will have to be sent to Amsterdam, though as an experiment I shall send you some.\n It must have slipped my memory, but according to my calculations I should still have a balance of about \u00a3300 with you if the proceeds of the last lot of pan-iron and the total on the Thomazine have been paid up, unless I have made a mistake. You can expect more pan-iron and other iron as soon as we have open waters.\n Let me know at once what ships you have chartered to go to St Ubes and then come here, and at what price, and when you estimate they can arrive here. Also, whether many grain ships are going to the Straits this autumn from your area. In these regions we are having a pretty tolerable winter, not very severe, and all the rivers are flowing so supplies are readily obtainable. I shall be glad to know if iron has been enjoying some sales with you and what you think about it. The high rate of exchange will remain as it was last year and all the principal iron-works have made contracts accordingly.\n It would have been a good thing if I had know that you were favourably inclined towards one or other of the works apart from the \u00a9. There were about 4.000 to 5.000 slb made this year and they were mostly shared, one half to London and the other half to Amsterdam. It is now much too late, but otherwise I should certainly have despatched some. One now draws on Amsterdam at 263 to 27 marks per RD. I could have obtained that iron for 31 dollars but I would guess that others now have to give 32. It stands at about [illegible]. This mishap will rather delay me in all my affairs and I shall have to remain rather longer in the country than I intended. Wishing you all happiness and success in this new year and many others to come, I remain, &c.\n[P.S.] Your letter of the 25th of November has arrived at last.",

    "TEXT": "This serves only to say that for some time I have had one case of Jauwers linen and one case of Sloyers in the hands of Mr James Bancks in [London] which he says he cannot sell. I think that is strange, seeing that linen is daily rising in price here. From time to time I sell plenty of the same sort to the English here who send it to [England] themselves and do well with it. So I suspect that, because the said James Bancks and his brother John Bancks especially trade actively in linen themselves and because they know that I have as good an opportunity to do so as they, they do not want to serve me with regard to linen and by not being able to sell any hope to make me decide not to send any more to England so that I will no longer be any obstacle to them. I wrote to him to this effect, since I saw that he could not sell any, and said that I had the opportunity to sell them to a friend here over a year ago, to which he replied that he would be delighted to transfer them to whomsoever I might order. Thus (in order not to invite any jealousy that the transfer might occasion, since James Bancks in [London] and Charles Bancks over here are my good friends) I have today drawn up a deed of assignment that the said two cases are to be transferred at the order of my brother [-in-law] Jean Baptista d\u2019Hertogh, and this has been endorsed by him to you pro forma. It comes herewith. So I ask you to send this assignment to Mr James Bancks and demand the aforesaid two cases to be transferred on presentation of my assignment, mentioning nothing more than that you are doing this on the orders of my brother [-in-law] Jean Baptista, and that it is for his account. By doing this you will oblige me greatly, and if you will sell the said Jauwers and Sloyers to my greatest advantage, either for cash or to people without liabilities, and if the experiment succeeds I shall keep you always supplied with these and other sorts of linen suitable for [England].\n You do not have to pay Mr Bancks any charges or anything else for them since I have written to him that I will make it good to his brother Charles here. In order to know that they really are my cases they should, in addition to my usual mark in black on the lid, be marked with a red mark thus, KK, - The case of linen [Jauwers] is also marked \u2018No. s\u2019 and the case of Sloyers #F. Perhaps, through standing around so long, the paper wrapping on the Jauwers and Sloyers have become rather unsightly and soiled, so please take off some layers and put fresh pieces on top which you can let the buyers see first, and then let me know what they can sell for.\n The dry weather continues and we may well have a short winter and be able to commence the sailing season somewhat earlier. Your advice to my sister Mahuis about prices will be useful for my consideration so that if the peace holds and the clouds of war pass by we can make a trial of something or other. May the Almighty protect you. With cordial regards, I remain, &c.",

You said you would be returning the f.400 received from Steenhoven. I do not understand, but if you want me to pay it back to the said Steenhoven I shall do it and inquire about him. As I said before, he seems a knowledgeable man.\n Icannot advise you about other trades to Bilbao. Many people sell baracans and it is a steady trade. This sample is lighter than those usually taken there, but they are all of this mixture. If I can do anything of service, please command me. With regards, God protect you, &c. \n[P.S.] Baracans are not usually as good as this sample.",

The principal dealers in most kinds of commodities, both in London and here, have their own agents both there and here so that for some time the reciprocal trade between England and here has been going very badly. I wish there might be some improvement so that we can find an opportunity to make a profit in something or other.\n I must thank you for your recommendation to your friend, Mr Jean Gosselin.

We have since received your welcome letter of the 15th of November with the bill of lading for your rodiron and the bar-iron from M. Ant. de la Bistrate, laden in [the ship of] Hendrick Claesen, with which we will supply ourselves. Neither he nor Adriansen have yet appeared.* For some days we have had a south wind (though it is at present westerly) so we hope to hear of them in a few days time. God bring them safely!\n We have still not heard from Mr Focken about his settlement of the disagreement with the owners of the Noot Muscatenboom? but Mr Jacobsen has today shown us information in his own hand to that effect, sent to him by the captain who ordered him to take custody of the money into his own hands and keep it until he arrives here\u2014whereupon we informed him that we had your order to receive your share and also Mr Radue\u2019s. We will come to an agreement with him and say no more about it.\n If Capt. Hendrick Claesen arrives here we will advance him your one-eighth share of the freight money, which we will make over to Caspar Bruyn together with the proceeds of your goods sent by him aboard Capt. Adriansen.\n You urge us to assist all the captains of any ships in which you have a part-interest. This we shall do to the best of our ability, as if for ourselves, but we do not understand whether the captains have orders from all the part-owners to address themselves to us. Meanwhile we will extend our help to any that come to our knowledge.\n You will have seen our order to procure the purchase of 2.000 slb of iron\u2014vizt. 3-part broad, 4 small, and 4 square. Please get it at the keenest price and make surc it is in good, even and equal sizes\u2014the square and small iron the lighter the better, of 9, 10, 11 or 12 feet long, but the broad ought to be according to the enclosed design? which is of a kind that comes from [Sweden] via Hamburg and is stamped with an \u2018F\u2019, which sells well here (if there is not too much of it) and is of the same type that we are asking for. As for the necessary purchase money, we have ordered you to draw at once RD 2.000 on Antoine dela Bistrate. If you have the opportunity of doing so profitably for us you can go up to six thousand rix-dollars and your bills will be promptly paid.\n Concerning your proposal that we should accommodate you (here, as is customarily done in Amsterdam) with money advanced upon the goods shipped here, we say that it can be done, as long as it is not too much or too often. As you will have observed from our preceding letter, we could easily go up to four, five or six hundred pounds per ship, but we do not find it advisable to have the insurance done here as most of our insurers are not to our liking. In case of a loss one has to wait, 3, 4 or 6 months, and then they deduct 15 or at least 10 per cent, as well as the premium, before they pay up. Therefore it is better to have it done in Hamburg or Amsterdam by those friends on whom you could draw the money, ordering them to reimburse themselves upon us. If you want the business to remain with us we shall arrange the insurance with the rest, remaining satisfied with + per cent for any outlay. And iron, copper or copper-wire will always sell freely, so we are in no fear of over-supplying the market except at some times when for one or two months the market is somewhat quieter than at other times; but that is to be expected in all places.

However, we shall rely on your discretion to manage matters as if yourself, trusting that the iron will be evenly forged from good material, according to our request. Speedy despatch is very important, so we urge you to look out for Abr.

Below the account is a specification of the interest placed to your debit. Please examine it and, finding it correct, please note it and drop me a line about your findings. Of the wire, I have sold to William Wathing 74 coils at \u00a36 10s per cwt. payable in 6 months. I shall do my duty with the remainder and let you know what happens. Meanwhile I am extremely sorry that it is going so sluggishly,! but one cannot do more than one\u2019s best, and it is commonly the case that when one has brought a commodity up to a high price the retailers do all that they can to avoid buying anything and to discourage one, and if they do buy anything it is only because they have no more, either to sell or work with. That is what they are doing now, and what they buy is only in small parcels and that only when it is absolutely necessary. However, it is my intention to keep the price up and I think I have good reason for doing so for there is only a little in town and that is all in my hands, besides which the prospect is that it will be two months before any more comes from [Sweden]. A person has offered me \u00a36 at 3 months for all which I have but I have refused him, considering it is better to do so and maintain the price in reputation until the first consignments arrive from [Sweden]. Thus, it is impossible to establish a new price-level unless there is an upsurge of demand, and then I shall be selling quantities all through the week, so that before long you can expect an account of it.\n Meanwhile I would be glad to learn what amounts you intend to consign to me. You would do well to send some copper bars as soon as possible as several ships will soon be getting ready to sail for Guinea and this commodity will be in demand, for there is none of it in town and large amounts will be required.

Gothenburg deals are very dear, selling at \u00a36 per cwt., and others accordingly. It has been said to me that you have agreed with our other friends in Sweden to consign all the copper-wire (which this place can consume) to one hand, but I believe that this has not yet been finally concluded for nothing has been written to me about it. If something like this has been decided I beg you to make me a participant. I have always sought every opportunity to procure your profit as if it were my own, and as the exchange has fallen so much I am very glad that I have remitted so much for your account at an advantageous price.

With it I gave you news of the sale of 74 coils of copperwire at \u00a36 10s per cwt. to William Wathing. Since then I have received yours of the 28th of February from which I see that you have returned home in good health, which Iam very glad to learn. God grant that you may long remain so.\n I see that you have received the sale account of the 2.357 coils of wire, found it correct and thus made a record of it, which is good. Of the remaining copper-wire I have sold 150 coils to Nathaniel Humphreys and others at \u00a36 6s per cwt., which you will please make a note of. I had thought of continuing the price at \u00a36 ros but there is always someone who will interfere, be it well or badly. This certain person, who has received several consignments from [Sweden], has had 200 coils from Hamburg which, as soon as it arrived, he sent a barge alongside to fetch the 200 coils and went selling it at \u00a36 ss per cwt, payable in 4 months according to what the buyer tells me, which is 5s below the market price. I cannot conceive what his purpose is in doing so but, meanwhile, that is the reason why I have had to sell at \u00a36 6s. How would it have been if the consignment had been bigger? I fear it would have gone badly. Therefore I would be very glad if you gentlemen [in Sweden] could agree to send all your copper-wire to me here, so that with all of it in one hand the price could be maintained and our friends could make a profit. Iam inclined to believe that that will come to pass (which I heartily wish for) for my Lord Cronstr\u00e9m informed me in his letter of 19 February that, upon the return to Stockholm of Abraham Wolters from Hamburg, I shall be sent some terms of correspondence and that he has recommended me. Whatever may come of it I shall be glad to learn for I would be happy to see your trade flourish, of which there is a sufficient prospect as it would be of great advantage to those gentlemen. For me, that is the most important consideration, and I look out for any way of serving you better; and, in order to encourage our friends in this matter I shall be content (with regard to the trade in copper-wire and copper-wares) with 14 per cent commission and 5 per cent per annum for interest on money advanced upon current account. As regards discount, that would continue at 6 per cent as most of the debts only get paid in cash 1, 20F 3 months after the due date. You could put this proposal (if it suits you) to our other friends and I have no doubt that it will greatly facilitate the business.\n As regards the sale of goods, you will have no reason for anything but satisfaction, and the interests of our friends will always remain uppermost with me. Please now write to our friends to submit this proposal and let me know what success you have. I would not trouble you with this if it were not that the matter concerns you principally, so I hope you will forgive me. Yours, &c.",

With the first I see that I run a great risk of losing my good old correspondents; with the second you give me reason to hope that you will stand by me, and with the last you confirm that you will continue with me and that you will stand by me, and with the last you confirm that you will continue with me and thereupon order me to get insured for \u00a35,000 the goods which you propose to consign to me in the ship called t'Graffelycke Huys de la Gardie, which I shall negotiate to have done at the best possible terms and will inform you when I succeed. Meanwhile, I am  waiting for the bill of lading and beg God to bring the ship and its cargo in safety, and whenever it arrives I shall do the utmost within my powers to sell the goods for you rgreatest profit. One pays 2 per cent here for insurance from Stockholm, and I hope to be able to select good insurers at that price, for which I shall do my best. \nBy way of answer to your welcome letters I must say, truthfully, that your complaints have upset me not a little, for I have not been accustomed to hear such things from my friends, though my comfort has been that ou would find me innocent of the intention which you charge me with. For the \u00a3200 formerly drawn by you on me, payable ot the order of Antony Bruyn, has been fulfilled by me without the least delay or disrespect to your bill, and I shall reimburse myself form the effects which you will be sending me this spring. It is true that in passing I wrote a word about it to the Messrs Van Baerle asking, if they did not min, if I might set it against the account of goods which I had in hand; but I never sought nor in the least intended to reimburse myself out of the goodsd which I had in hand, or to divert anything against their intentions or goodwill. They misunderstood what I wrote, and as soon as I had their answer about the bill (the \u00a32,000 being by then already paid) I wrote back to them without a moment's loss that they had badly interpreted my letter and that - as I have said above - I only wanted to be reimbursed from the promised effects; and sicne they informed me that they had written to you about the matter as they understood it, so I begged you to forgive the blunder and to think no more about it, as I now do, hoping that no such error will occur again. \nNow, I rejoice from the bottom of my heart that my proposal came in time to confirm our correspondence, and the conditions which i therewith offered I confirm with this ,trusting that you and the other friends will be content with them and do nothing to reduce the commission. I can well believe that some people from other places may offer to serve you for 1 per cent commission (although that is very little for a person who wants to do his duty properly) but London differs considerably from other place, and I would say that a person can profit more in Hamburg by working for 1 per cent than here for 2 per cent, and one can do more there with one servant than here with two; for over there they have banks where most money is paid; the town is small, and thus all your debtors are under your eye; there are few difficulties in the Customs house; great quantities are bought, mainly for re-export elsewhere, and for cash. But here it is different. We ehave to receive and pay out all ou rmoney ourselves, and the town is large and many customers live 2 or 3 miles from the Exchange, to whom one has to run, which caues expense and for which several people have to be employed.  The trouble we have with our customs officials is impossible to desbribe, for there is no question, quibble or quirk but they know how to torment the merchant with it; and then, in order to sell the goods, one has to deal with people who will only buy small quantities and then take pleasure in making me and my servants run after them for payment over 2 or 3 months; so, considering all that, I hope you will think and believe that my commission is very reasonable and be satisfied that, as regards the iron, the commission may also be reckoned at 1 1/2 per cent. \nIf you give orders to draw some sum on me at the same time that you send the bill of lading and instructions for insurance, as you are proposing, I shall follow your orders on the understanding that your intention will be to draw only a part of the value of goods, for an insurance policy cannot be thought of as complete cover - firstly, because it is customary her ein case of a loss (from which, may God preserve us!) for the insurers to deduct usually 10, 12 or 15 per cent of the principal, and thus the premium here is always smaller than at Amsterdam or Hamburg, &c; but if the goods have arrived here I shall be always ready to advance three-quarters or more of the value, either by remitting the money or having it drawn on me, as it suits you. \nOne reason which has impelled me to watn to serve our friends for 1 1/2 per cent commission and 5 per cent per annum interest has been to be excused from advancing anything before I first have goods in hand, so that some of my clients - who entrust me with considerable sums - may be so much the easier in their minds. However, in order to demonstrate to you my affection and respect, I shall be happy to extend a thousand or twelve hundred pounds advance during the winter to be reimbursed by you in the spring, just as ou have proposed, nevr in the least doubting your punctuality. I beg you to say or write nothing about this to anyone because I am not contemplating advancing anything to other friends in such a manner, and whenever they leaern that one is allowing one friend and such terms they think they have a right to demand similar ones. \nI heartily wish you had informed me a bout your displeasure over what I wrote to Messrs Van Baerle concerning the aforementioned \u00a3200, and I thank you warmly for telling me about it now, begging you in our future friendshipp to write to me if it should ever happen that you have some occasion for displeasure; and I promise you that I shall respond in such a way as to remove all misunderstanding, for some time things can be said or done with the best of intentions (or, at least, without evil intentions) whihc being otherwise interpreted can tourn out badly. Wherewith, cordial regards, &c.",
