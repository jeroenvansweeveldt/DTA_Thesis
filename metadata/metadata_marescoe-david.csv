safety, The market is weak here and from others we have learned that these same goods can
now be had for sss in [London], so in future they are likely to fall lower here. Meanwhile we
hope you have bought and shipped the 20 sacks of Barbados cotton. The greatest speed is
essential—also that the goods are clean and soft.

We hope you have procured payment of the £200 sterling which we remitted to you,
drawn on William Rivet. With that you can pay for the cotton you have bought.

Sugar is too dear in [London] and one can count on no profit in sending it here, so one
must wait for it to fall lower in [London] or rise higher here. One can easily get it here at 8¢
for lack of buyers. Silk is plentiful and cheap—Ardasse can be got for 17 1/2s.

We have accepted the bill of exchange for £170 drawn at 34s 1og, at double usance,

13th of December and 3rd of January and fully understand the contents, to which our answer
briefly follows.

Concerning the Tar Company’s bill of exchange, the matter will be settled as soon as Mr
Hendrick Thuen returns home. He is away at present and has been expected back for some
days. We have noted what has been happening in the sale of our goods and will await the
account thereof, It is good to see that Dirck Thyssen has delivered to you the 324 bars of iron
and the 20 barrels of steel on our account, and we also note the price at which you have sold
the steel, but we are not happy to learn that some of the barrels were of such short weight. We
will make enquiries here, as they were weighed at the works by our own people who have
express orders always to ensure that, including the barrels, they weigh net 120 lb. Danzig-
weight. We weigh it in this manner, as in Danzig, so that the barrels together with any excess
weight have been paid for. See if they weighed it in this way in [London], or have weighed
the steel only without the barrels, and please let me known for my future guidance. And as I
have the opportunity to send a good deal of such steel (having that privilege from His
Majesty) I beg you to let me know how large an amount you would be able to consume
yearly so that I can employ my works accordingly.

Inote that pitch and tar have fallen in price in [London]: I shall be glad to be kept informed
of further developments. I have also noted the money you have remitted to Mr Caspar
Bruyn, as well as the £20 you have paid to Mr Johan Simons. I shall be grateful if you would
help in every way, and if he should need another £20 or £30 please let him have it. Any
money which you may have due to us, please make over to Caspar Bruyn as he will need
some money on our account. I have already written to Mr Pelt Emanuels that he should place
the money which Capt. Fix paid to you to our account. I trust he had done so and will not be
writing to you about it any more as we have put his account right.

We long to hear that Capt. Coomen, who is sailing to [London] from Gotland, has arrived
safely and that his timber has found a good market. Our agent in Gotland tells us that it is
very fine timber, and doubtless with the rebuilding of London a great deal of wood will be
required. Please find out for us if some ships’ lading of such balks and deals would sell on
delivery and if one could get a good price for them, as we would gladly oblige. No one is in a
better position to do so as we can have all the timber which Gotland produces in our hands.
So please make inquiries and let us know what you think. We can have it cut to such lengths
and breadths as people want, and the deals also, but you must write to us with the
measurements—and please find out if we are free to send them in Dutch ships.

The 6 tuns of potash, which will be sent to you with the first available ship, are only an
experiment, and if we perceive any profit in it we will send a larger amount. It is the same
with the Gotland tar, which always costs more than Swedish tar. Do your best in all this as if
it were for yourself, and let us have your detailed comments so that we can act accordingly.
We have noted what you wrote about the kinds of iron which sell, and it is most instructive.
With God’s help we will provide you with a large amount in the spring.

As my brother Jacob will not be living here regularly but will be spending most of his time
at his brass-foundry in Norrköping, we have divided our trading, and what hitherto came
from here please regard as mine only, unless it is expressly stated to belong to someone else’s
account. You will likewise get directions from me about what has, and will, come from
Gotland, so from now on I will be writing to you in my own name and you can reply to me
likewise so we can settle matters with one another. However, what you have just remitted to
Amsterdam and have in your hands from here and Gotland is still in both our names.

They write to me from Sweden that all the Orgrons iron has been bought up, so all of it
will come here, and you can also expect all the ‘O’ and ‘G’ iron,(2) which means that it can be
held at a suitable price; for that reason I have expressly not wanted to sell it for delivery in
Sweden, in order that it can be kept in one hand and not undercut.

One should be able to insure from London to Guinea and back again for 14 to 15 per cent,
independently of any Dutchmen, because since most of that coast is now occupied by them
the insurers would raise difficulties about a ship trading to a place where it is not permitted to
go. It would run the risk of being seized, and if one made difficulties about putting in a
proviso they would guess what the intention was and insist on more than a doubled
premium.

Please Iet me know how things stand with the salvaged cannon-balls, for I have heard
nothing about them.

As the insurance to Guinea is not a normal one and as my usual insurance-broker is not
very suitable, he has not categorically agreed to it, it being his opinion that the objections
mentioned above will be insisted upon.

£166 9s 2d sterling for your account. Herewith goes the second copy in case the first is lost.
Since then we have received your letter of the 20th past with the following remittances for
the account of Mr Willem Momma at Nyköping, vizt.

£240 at 345 4g, 2 usances, in your own bill on Nicholas Korf;

£80 as above, on Anselmus Hartsen;

£100 as above, in a bill of Jean Dorville on Frederick Dorville;

£74 13s 4d at 34s 7g, 2 1/3 usances, in a bill of Daniel Porten on Joseph van Ast at Antwerp.

We have secured acceptance of the first and also the last, and have informed Momma. The
remittances were for the proceeds of the copper-wire out of Pieter Hartman and William
Greene, of which we have made a note. We look forward to learning what else has occured in
the sale of the remaining copper-wire and brass, though while the exchange is so very low
please do not remit the proceeds. We must hope that the exchange improves; meanwhile, sell
for the shortest time possible.

As regards Nicholas Korf, he is a man of little credit and small business, who is not much to
be relied on; we understand he is going to live in Rotterdam next month, for your
information.

We have received the bill of lading for the sugar shipped in John Goldsborough, but the
invoice and the list of weights is not with it, so please let us have it. Concerning the freight,
we will see if they will be satisfied with 4.000 lb. net per last; ifnot, we must pay for the gross
weight as is customary here.

We see that you have recorded your agreement with the account of the sugar from
Mackrel, but that the tare, short-weight and allowance for prompt payment takes away most
of the profit. The tare of 15 per cent on big barrels and 16 on small is a customary condition
here which it is useless to dispute; the 1 per cent for making good short weight has also been
claimed by the sugar-refiners for some time and without it they will not offer a penny; and
the 1 per cent for prompt payment is advantageous to the vendor if he otherwise has to wait
three months for payment.

The price of Barbados sugar remains still between 7 3/8g to 7 7/8g according to quality. We
have had no news of James Hatton or of John Goldsborough, although as the wind is
favourable we expect to have news of their arrival any day.

Of the lead, we have only sold 50 pigs of the great lead from Anthony Winter to Jacob
Charles at 28s 6g flem. with 1 per cent discount for payment within 3 weeks. There is no
demand for small lead at the moment. We have written to our friend in Rotterdam to sell the
100 pigs of lead from Bywater as best he can but have had no answer. English tin is selling at

f.50 1/2 but it is believed it will shortly fall to f-50 since, according to the latest letters which

what you have done about my order to buy galls, as well as currants, for which you can lay
out 43 to 44s for really sound goods. I can well believe that, before these voyages, the Levant
trade was making very little profit.

You received my order to lay out £300 to £400 on Barbados sugar and have bought 24
butts of very good quality at 28s, to be laden in [Capt.] Andries Rump. I look forward to
hearing that it has been successfully completed, and to receiving the account and invoice. I
wish very much that I had not given you my order to buy 2.000 lb. at Bristol for 26s now that
you have bought for me in [London] at 28s, since the expense and risk between Bristol and
[London] amounts to more than 2s per cwt. It would have been best if the price differed not
less than 35 or 4s; so please revoke my order for that amount since no profit can be made by it,
seeing that that commodity has also fallen here from 8g to 7 1/2, 7 1/4 or 7g according to quality. I
see little prospect of it improving unless it rises in price in [London] and less comes from
Barbados, as you believe.

40s per week fora big warehouse rental is too much money and too burdensome. [......].(1)
If the ships bring any tamarind to [London], I shall be glad to hear, and with cordial regards I
commend you to God’s protection, &c.","London: 33s 10-11g (2 usances)

&c.",AMSTERDAM,AMSTERDAM 1 JUNE 1668,,"Dear Sir, We last wrote about a week ago; since then we have received yours of the 15th past
to which the following is our answer.

We have sold the 26 hogsheads of Barbados sugar, which came with [Capt.] Adrian
Goossen, to Paulus Kalckberner at 73 with 1 per cent discount for immediate payment, and
the 42 blocks of tin from [Capt.] Philip Cockran to Matthys Booden at f-503 per 100 lb. on
the same terms. Herewith we send the account of both, together with an account of the 693
pieces of small lead from (Capt.] George Fowler. The net proceeds of the sugar amount to
‘f.2676 17st; of the tin, to f-4674; and of the lead, to f.5753 1st 8g, all in bank money. Please
check them, and, if you find no mistakes, make a record of them.

The amount of sugar which has come to Zeeland from Surinam is not nearly as great as we
had first been told, and seems to be about 400.000 lb., as a result of which Barbados sugar is
being maintained at 7g to 74g, but as the demand for refined sugar is small there is little
prospect oft rising and we cannot guess what future prices can be obtained, so we wish you
would consider it preferable to sell it in London.

Great lead was selling in Rotterdam for 27s 6g flem. and it cannot be sold here for more
than 28s at three months time. Since you have complained about the low price we have kept
unsold what there is here and at Rotterdam. As for the small lead out of Henry Kirckhouse
we have sold 100 pieces to Marten Van Lidt at 275 3g with 1 per cent discount for immediate
payment. Since then, we have been offered only 27s at three months. We shall be glad to learn
if the tin account answered your expectations. Various amounts have been sold at f'505, and if
the expected East India ships bring no tin the price could well improve. You will have heard
by now what the three East India ships which arrived here brought with them: we forgot to
tell you in our last letter.

We still cannot send you the sale-account of the 18 barrels of sugar in [Capt.] Mackrel since
we have not settled with the captain yet. We find that some of the barrels in Mackrel, as well
as in Goossen, do not weigh as much as they should according to the invoice. We suspect they
have been tampered with by the sailors though we do not know any means of getting
restitution as the barrels seem, to all appearances, intact. The captains will not admit to any
knowledge of the reduced weight.
We intended to remit you herewith all your proceeds, but have been unable to find
satisfactory bills as so much money has been remitted to London today that the exchange has
risen, as you can see below, so we remit you only:

£700 sterling in a bill of Bartolotti & Rihel, to be received at 2 usances from Laurence
Dibusty @ 34s 11 1/2d;

£168 125 4g, which is W.745 23s @ 54 1/2d, dated 6 April, drawn on Rudolf Lee, endorsed
by us and reckoned at 34s 11g. Please procure their acceptance and credit us. As for the £100
sterling @ 35s 6g which you have remitted us on Dirck van Huisbergen due on the 4th
instant, we shall procure payment and make youa return. We understand that Nicholas Korf
has left for London. Your two drafts on him have been registered in the bank for us by his
brother-in-law Barthout Ockers. This first is due in six days and the other before the
departure of the post.

We regret to see the poor price of copper-wire and do not know how to advise you except
to follow the orders of our friends in Sweden. The copper-wire from Norrköping is nearly as
good as Hamburg wire and is now selling at f-55 per 100 lb. The ‘Crowned N’ variety is
selling at f.54 so it is no use bringing it from here or from Hamburg at the price it is fetching
with you. Although the amount which our Swedish friends have sent is too large, the kettles,
pans, latten and other brassware ought to fetch a good price, seeing that the French have
wrecked the brass-works round Aachen and chased away the workers.

Jacob Momma advises us that a ship called St Jan Battista, Captain Claes Symons Schult, is
being loaded for London in which he intends to send a good quantity of brass and iron. We
were also glad to see that the amount coming here has not made the price weaken. In due
course you will please make good the proceeds as Momma doubtless will instruct you.

the case that I wrote that the cannon-balls should come to London, nor was it ever my
intention, and if it seems to say so in my letter of the 8th instant then it was badly copied, for
the intention is that ifa good opportunity should arise at the place where the cannon-balls are
lying to send them to Lisbon then it should not be neglected but taken at once.

I am glad to see that you have sold a quantity of iron. I shall not be able to send so much
voyage iron this year, for it was only made at one forge and I ordered all of it to be sent to
you, and as the forge was making other sorts of iron last winter there will probably not be so
much. They write from Stockholm that iron is coming in rather slowly, so it may be rather
late before the ships depart, and if there is a demand for what you already have, try to regulate
consumption by concealing 1/8 or 1/9 of the quantity.
I have been approached here about selling my share of the iron which was in the Stockholm,
wrecked on the English coast.(1) They think to get it for 4 or 5 per cent, but I have disposed of
it for one-third. If 1 decide otherwise I shall send someone from here to fish it up. Time will
tell what further developments may follow.

News has reached here from St Kitts that more than 2.000,000 lb. of sugar has been
destroyed by fire on Barbados and that few houses have been damaged. I hope it is not really
so bad: may the Lord grant consolation for such a heavy affliction.

Herewith I remit you £221 5s@ 34s 10¢ for your account. I have not yet had the account
from Reval, but that can do no harm since the man must have money. I wish it was the same
with that from Copenhagen, where I am lacking both the account and my money. I am
thinking of sending someone there shortly in order to know exactly how things stand.

If Clignet draws £120 or £130 sterling, please pay it, mais ne luy donnez pas avis que vous
en avez ordre unless it is drawn.

8th of May, which herewith follows.
I have looked over the accounts you have sent and have adjusted them as you will have
seen in the enclosed note. If you find them correct please make a record of it. The 65 RD from
Baron Sparr (1) have not yet been received but they will be shortly and will then be placed to
your credit. The £30 you have paid to Mr Jan Simons has also been noted, and if he should
want another £30 or £40 please let him have it and place it on my account.

The schuit (2) which I am thinking of using for salvage work is now ready to sail. It is called
the St Peter and the captain is Matthys Meyer. I have consigned her lading to you for my
account as you will see from the enclosed bill of lading. May God protect her and bring her in
safety! I rely on you to do your best to sell the goods. Among them are two bundles of band-
iron, hammered not drawn, and I shall be glad to learn how well they sell. In Holland band-
iron has sold at 2 1/2 to 3 per cent higher than fine bar-iron, and if it fetches a good price in
[London] I am in a good position to have it made. I await your comments.

I have read the detailed report which you have written to me about timber, which is
instructive, but to charter as many ships as you suggest is hardly advisable as freight-rates are
too high. However, I shall see what I can do. We are expecting two salt-ships at Gotland
(may God bring them safely) and they will then be sent to [London] with timber.
Meanwhile, keep me informed about what is happening to this commodity in [London].

Isce that you have sold the 16 lasts of Gotland tar at £10 10s per last, which is a poor price.
It may well be that it is not as highly esteemed in [London] as Stockholm tar, but in other
places they give a good deal more for it than for what comes from here. To charter ships from
[London] to here is not opportune as by now as many as 14 Setubal salt-ships are passing
through the Sound from here and they all have consignments in them.

Jan Juyst has paid me the £67 tos for Jan Simons’ bill of exchange, and I have credited
your account.

Isce you have been unable to get any buyers yet for the 6 tuns of potash. They were only
sent as an experiment: please do your best with them and see how much they can fetch, for
our future guidance. If it proves worthwhile we may send a further quantity.

I note you to say that at least 6.000 houses are being built in [London], which must
consume a great deal of timber. You also say that you think at least 1.000 to 1.500 lengths of
Gotland beams at 40s per length and 20.000 to 25.000 deals at £6 10s per hundred could be
sold—to which you await our decision. In answer I can only say that I cannot supply such a
quantity while freight-rates are so high. However, we will see what we can do. My brother
Jacob is in Gotland at present and has a ship-builder with him as we are thinking of having
some fluyt-ships built there—so with wood and timber-ware may God grant us fortune and
His blessing!

Meanwhile, keep me always informed about what is happening in [London] concerning
timber-ware. I am glad to see that small-iron is now sought after in [London], because what I
send is mostly of that sort. Keep me informed how each type is selling. That you have been
able to get 15s [per cwt.] for our ‘voyage’ iron is good news. If I were certain that it could
always sell like that I would have a large amount forged, so I shall await your opinion on this.
Please also let me know how Setubal salt is selling in [London].

Isee that you have consulted with Jan Simons about the surety for the goods which are still
in the wreck of the Stockholm and I note your opinion on the matter, which is helpful. I have
written to Jan Simons at greater length in the enclosed letter. Please hand it to him and help
him in every way, for which we will be most grateful.

I have not been able to get the schuit ready for use sooner, otherwise it would have left for
[England] by now. God protect him and bring him in safety—and then I hope something
may be achieved this summer, as time will tell.
I have loaded for my account in the Deensche Pheenix, which will be ready in a few days:

Slb. 884.12 various sorts of fine bar-iron;
Slb. 263.6 rod-iron;

106 casks of steel in tall casks;

52 ditto in flat casks;

83 1/2 dozen long deals, to complete the cargo,

all of which is consigned to you. The bill of lading will be sent with my next letter, and when
the ship arrives in [London] I beg you to unload it as soon as possible and speed it on its way to
St Ubes in ballast as it has also been chartered by Mr Pétter as usual so that it can complete its
journey before the winter. Please help the captain, who is Claus Willman, in every way, and
we will be most grateful.

I have ordered these goods, as well as those in the schuit, St Peter to be insured by Peter
Simons in Amsterdam. I hope to God the premium will be justified. Since I have charged him
with some bills of exchange which are going to fall due soon, I have written to tell him to
correspond with you and to draw on you for my account; and if some misfortune should
overtake the goods (which God forbid!) you could draw on him in return as he will have had
them insured. And I would like you to allow Mr Simons to draw on you nine or ten thousand
rixdollars. Please accommodate him. The interest on what you advance will be made good,
and I shall shortly be sending you more goods of which you will be advised.

Your letters of the 15th and 22nd of May to my brother Jacob have been received in his
absence, and —following his instructions—I have opened them and read their contents. I am
delighted to see that Capt. Erick Erickson has arrived. God be thanked for his blessings! As to
the money you have advanced on his goods—he will gladly make it good, regarding $ per
cent per month interest as cheap. It is good that you have told Mr Hiebenaer that he may
draw on you up to 8.000 RD, and if it does not inconvenience you, you could, according to
your offer, remit the remainder to Messrs Van Baerle as it is more profitable for my brother.
He will make good the interest on what you advance.

However, I am not happy to see that the price of copper-wire is so low, and I hope it will
improve. Here copper prices are rising as the copper mine is producing little because of some
roof-falls which have occurred. I shall inform my brother of what you write about the
various sorts of wire, and I shall be glad to learn to whom the 1.650 coils of wire from Cock
have come. As for my brother’s affairs, I hope he will have returned home in a month or six
weeks time. Your enclosure to Mr Hegerstiern* came to me under the cover of Mr Caspar
Bruyn’s and was accidentally opened in the presence of two good friends. Nothing in it was
read, but it was sealed up again and sent to his house where he opened it and then sealed it
again and returns it to you again. In future, please do not.send him any letters under cover to me or Mr Bruyn. Wherewith, regards, &c.",,A. LETTERS TO CHARLES MARESCOE,DUTCH,1668,24 JUNE 1668,13 Jul. 1668,17 Jul. 1668,,1376,,

it, but if it should fall to 26s please perform my commission. A large amount has arrived in
Holland with the East India ships; in Portugal the Brazil fleet is also expected to bring a great
quantity, and although in the last two months not much sugar has come from the Barbadoes

you—about which you await our opinion. To which we answer that we find it more
profitable for Momma and more convenient for us to draw on you at double usance, as we
wrote previously, and therefore beg you to make no remittances unless something is rebated
and paid down by the purchasers or unless the exchange rises higher in the near future. You
will charge Momma 6 per cent per annum interest on the money you advance on account of
his goods (as is provided in our contract with him) making good our share. We trust you do
not find it strange that we enjoy some profit thereby, because after all we advance the full
value of the goods without having them in our hands. Nevertheless, if you think 43 per cent
to be too little interest, you can deduct 5 per cent and leave us to enjoy 1 per cent. Please do
not betray this to Momma, so that he is given no grounds for allowing us less than the 6 per
cent stipulated.

to Momma’s account and endorse the second copy to us. We have today drawn on you, for
the same account, £600, namely:

amount of your proceeds, so we herewith remit you our first bill of 7.500 in a bill of Jean des

Concerning the square iron—£13 in cash is a low price and is not very satisfactory. It
would be better next time to sell itat £13 10s for time, and my idea was to dispose of only a
little in the hope that square iron would soon be in demand since so little has been sent. You
should know best whether there is much square iron around in your area, and if so, you
should be able to judge how much to withhold. I rely on you in this to do as you think
advisable. I do not quite understand your intention—that is, whether you meant to sell it for
cash or to barter it for tin and account for it as if the tin had been paid for in cash. If it should
be paid for in tin you can send it over here straight away, but please make sure that it is
smelted cleanly and not with coal, as it is presently ata rather low price and people are rather
choosy!—and if it is pure one immediately has an advantage in selling it.

You must do this for the square iron but not for the flat iron, unless there is only a little flat
iron remaining, for if one should reckon 8o tons of square and 20 tons of flat at an average of
£13 per ton then the square iron would work out at scarcely £124 per ton, since flat iron is
worth so much more than £13 per ton. According to my best recollection there must be still
about 3.000 bars of flat iron, though I may be mistaken as I am in no position here to check it,
Please reflect on this and do what you judge suitable. You should also take into consideration
that, by all appearances, not more than 2.000 slb of ‘O’ and ‘G’ flat iron can be expected, apart
from the voyage iron—that is, if Bex despatched in one ship the rest of the iron he was
ordered to send here.

If I gave £6 per ton for what is to come from Barbados I would be obliged to load the
whole ship, or else he would have to look around for the rest of his lading and I would have to
make up for what falls short, or else be responsible for a share of his cargo. It is strange that
Abcels has not written to advise us how things stand over there, for our guidance.

Since itis rather late for the Pyper to go to Sweden, it is best that he goes to La Rochelle or
Bordeaux for the vendange, for unless some other good opportunity arises I am confident he
will get a good return at Bordeaux. Please advise him of this. He reached the Sound on the
3rd of this month but since then has had contrary winds.

We had written this far when we got your letter of the 31st of July with which came a
copy of the contract which you and Mr Thuen have made together concerning our
Company’s business, Through a lack of time we cannot read it over, and we will let you
know what we think of it by our next. You say that you want us to send 550 lasts of tar and
120 lasts of pitch to [London], and the rest of the 700 lasts of tar and 200 of pitch to Hull,
Yarmouth and the Isle of Wight. You will see from the bills of lading how much we have so
far sent to [London], being in all 432 lasts 1 tun of tar and 144 lasts of pitch. In addition, as we
have just said, Elias Johansen is loading and Hans Johansen has been chartered, so you can
expect to get the requested amount of tar at [London] and a good deal more than the
requested amount of pitch. But as regards the amounts requested for other places such as
Hull, Yarmouth and the Isle of Wight, we fear we will find no shipping going there, but we
will do our best and let you know what we arrange. Concerning insurance and cash advances,
we refer you to our previous letter, not doubting that whenever our goods arrive you will,
according to contract, advance the money, and we request you to correspond with Mr
Simons about this as we said in the copy above. Meanwhile we are very glad to hear of the
arrival of Capt. Hans Tennissen: may the Lord God be thanked who with His gracious help
may have since brought the others in safety, as they followed him shortly after. We expect to hear soon. If we are going to insure the ships still lying here off-shore we will advise you,

Mr Thuen’s arrival here. We have credited you with the £150 sterling which you paid him,
It is a good thing that you have chartered Capt. Heinrich Meyer of Norrköping to go
from here to either Hull or Yarmouth. We have done our utmost to find shipping from here
to any of the places you requested but until now without success. We are now in negotiation
with someone but it seems he has little desire to go. We will advise you of our success by our

serves only to say that Captain Anders Beursen arrived here some days ago and tells me that
the 450 slb of voyage iron which I last consigned to you aboard him was sold as soon as it
landed, which is good.

Since then, we have had so little water inland that we could not get any voyage iron, but
we have now had so much rain that water is very abundant and we have now got over 300 slb
from up-country. Anders Beursen only has 100 slb aboard him, but the rest will go together
in his ship which you can expect in due course. I have seen some Englishmen here who would
gladly buy this consignment from me, but we could not agree. Someone called David
Matson bought a quantity from me some time ago and shipped it to England.

Samuel Rutter writes to me that in addition to the £85, he has paid out to you £154 8s 6d
for my account, which I hope you will have remitted to Mr Bex before receiving this, as well
as anything which arises from the sale of my iron.

[P.S.] Monsieur Marescoe, before closing this I received yours of the 21st and 25th past by
which I learn that you had only sold 2 of the iron received from Anders. I have no doubt that
you will have sold the rest since then. From the English here I have had many requests for
voyage iron, but to prevent it coming into too many hands I shall not sell. 1 am glad to see
that you have remitted £350 to Mr Bex for my account at 35s 6g, double usance. I have also
made a note on the account concerning Samuel Rutter. Rutter has sent me, via Anders
Beursen, an account of the ship’s sale and other matters between us. He is an experienced and
good seaman to whom one may safely entrust a ship. It is a good thing he is now free from

fine currants at 44s. If they are choice, I shall be glad, and hope to learn by your next in whom
they have been shipped. You were unable to achieve anything regarding sugar. If, with the
arrival of future shipments, it should faller lower and you judge the price to be at its lowest,
then buy me 12.000 to 15.000 lb., but it is no use to me if it costs more than 26s, and it must be
choice stuff, because there is plenty here and I must have only the very choicest, choice
quality. Always bear that in mind when buying for me. The ships from Scanderoon have
arrived and in your opinion galls are at their lowest. If you can get 20 barrels for less than sos
make sure the galls are big, heavy and blue. Aleppo galls are also welcome here. Camphor is
regarded asa drug; it comes in little tubs, looks like snow but when refined is like crystal and
at present fetches here 4o stuivers unrefined and so stuivers refined. If what they call camphor
in [England] can be had for 6 to 10s it must be something else, so if possible send me a sample
of the raw commodity for my guidance. If it can be brought here for less than 40 stuivers I
would buy 500 lb. It is also used for perfume.

Sir, I would like to have 2.000 to 3.000 lb. of syrup from [London], but syrup is not
allowed to be imported here unless it pays 1 stuiver per lb. To avoid that, I should like to ask
you to get 2 empty pipes of oil that have been boiled clean and firmly reinforced with hoops
so that they do not leak. Fill them up with syrup and firmly close up the tops with nails so
they cannot be opened. They should get in safely, and I would then give you a good
commission, but they must be kept steady and above all the casks must be thick so that they
do not discover by leakage that it is not oil inside. Also, in shipping them you must not give
the captain to understand that there is anything but oil inside, and on the bill of lading put
down that they are to deliver these pipes to Hay t’Yercks marking them HTY in case of any
unexpected hitch, although do not make any difficulty about the manner in which it is done.

learn of your good health. As for me, I thank God I am well. I see that you and Mr Hendrick
Thuen drank my health in a glass of wine: thank you for your kind remembrance of me, and
as soon as Hendrick Thuen comes home again we shall drink your health in return.

I see that Mr Thuen has been establishing a secure business for the Tar Company in
[England], in which he will use you—which I am very happy to learn. It would be a good
thing if our company could at last be put on a firm footing so that we could for once be
allowed to enjoy some profits, which could be achieved with good management. I hope that
Mr Thuen has put things in good order in [England], as well as in Holland and other places.

Thank you for your kind offer to serve me whenever I have any goods to send, which I
will accept. I cannot overlook you since you have served me so well in the past, which
encourages me to employ you further—and I would have done so already if it were not that
iron has been at so low a price in [England] that I and others have been frightened off from
sending any iron to [England]. For at £124 and £13 per ton there is nothing to be done: it
must fetch £14 to £15, and then I might have something to send. I see that broad iron is
fetching the highest price. It is important that I should know which kinds of iron are in most
demand and fetch the most money, so that I can have them made at my works. If 1 knew
what price anchors were at in [England] I could yearly send you 100 to 200 slb. Here they cost
30 to 32 copper dollars per shippound. I have about 80 slb of large anchor-flukes lying here,
which I cannot easily sell. If 1 could sell them in [England] I would send them to you—to
which I await your reply.

I and some other friends have decided to carry on an iron-works located in Varmland
which can produce 2.000 to 3.000 slb of iron yearly and likewise 100 to 200 slb of copper at
the least. If the mine were extended it could well produce 300 to 500 slb of copper, but I
cannot guarantee so large an amount until we see how the mine turns out, which one can do
better when it is working. We will send the iron and copper to Gothenburg. When the works
are in operation I shall probably have need of 3.000 to 5.000 RD at a low rate of interest. If
you were willing to accommodate me I could ensure that you receive large commissions.
Please send me your views on this as soon as possible, as well as the price of anchors and bar- iron. If I see any profit in them I shall send you some in the Spring. I look forward to your

consigned to Mr Thomas Death and Mr Ephraim Skinner of this citty sort (1) with order to
remitt the same in good bills to each of you the halfe. Wee hope said Capt. Stafford is a good
way toward that port ere this. Wee make you debtor in your new account for the amount of
this parcel 13.320 R. pta., being, beside the principall 7 per cent exchange, 1 per cent
conveyance, 1/2 per cent commission in Cadiz and 2 1/2 per cent our commission. That sort is
now worth in Cadiz 8 to 9 per cent exchange, soe for the future wee must rather chuse to send
of the yellow sort. Your account current wee send you herewith, wherein are included all
parcells wee can perfect as yett, only in the debtor wee have not charged this parcell per
Stafford but in the new account, being Mr Letheuilleir’s account was not charged with itt,
which wee remitted him two posts since, and we have made you good the ballance of this
account in your new account, being three thousand five hundred and one R. pta., which
finding right you may please to note accordingly. Wee have charged you therein the money

to recover some part of it hereafter which whenever it is shall be made you good.

As for your lamparillas, we have advised those gentlemen that bought them, Mons. de
Hollandre & Company, their qualletty as well in the coursenesse and ill sortment of cullers,
and to take off their lookcing like picots wee have got them doubled like Jamparillas, that may

think their voyage will be in the spring if the last orders from the Counsell be observed, butt
if soe will be without any flota ships. Wee have advised Mr Letheuilleir the arrivall of Capt.
Stafford and the receipt of your goods by him. At present wee have a very dull markett and
very few of our English goods sell; the vintage ships at Malaga somewhat glutt the marketts;
bayes have now the best expense and rissen here to 24 ducats.

Your accounts merchandize wee keepe to send by sea, which shall goe per a small vessel
that may be gocing home in 10 or 12 dayes. Logwood is here worth seaven pieces of eight per

letter you will have learned from your brother-in-law, Mr John Lethieullier, of the sale of the
448 pieces of small-lead on the Europa to Bortolo Marinoni at 55 ducats, less 1 per cent tare
and 6 months discount, to pay in three months time. We decided on this as we see little
prospect of it doing better, as there are at present over 1.000 pieces in town unsold, and there
will shortly be a quantity coming with the fish-ships, probably before the Europa reaches
Leghorn. So we were of the opinion it was more likely to fall than otherwise.

Concerning the 467 pieces of small-lead on the Lantsman (which was on the point of
leaving Leghorn) we are in negotiation and, if we cannot do so at the foot of this letter we
will advise you of our success by our next, and we do not doubt that you will be grateful for
what we decide.

300 pieces have been unloaded from the John & Thomas and delivered to Lorenzo Bettoni.
The rest is to follow next week, and we hope to be able to send the account by our next letter.
Pepper was selling at 150 ducats at 2 months time and is still being held at that price. Good
quality cinnamon is at 108 dollars (poor quality is unsaleable), cloves at 65 dollars, sappan-
wood at 70 ducats with 4 months time. Otherwise no changes of any importance.",,A. LETTERS TO CHARLES MARESCOE,DUTCH,1668,2 NOVEMBER 1668,10 Nov. 1668,12 Nov. 1668,,257,,

letters of the 23rd and 30th October.

I have come to an agreement with Rosheuysen concerning the £80 in view of the fact that
he has not settled with me for the expenses.

I hope you have been able to procure freedom for Capt. Grys as well for the Beer, in the
event of them having to be newly-built, for the fine iron should be more serviceable to you.
Please let me know if it is only ships with iron which can come in freely, because I understand
that previously a distinction was made between iron and tar. I had always thought that broad
iron was in demand [in England] and consequently had it expressly made. I shall now give
orders to make no more, but only flat iron of various breadths like that which, I trust, you
have now received and which you can count on in the future.

I had not expected any letter from Clignet, although he is sometimes rather hasty. I shall
give some thought to it at once. The best of it is that he does not have much left on his hands. I
wrote to him at length three weeks ago about what he claims and sent him an account,
allowing him what is due for his trouble. You can always open his letters to me, as well as
mine to him, if you want to: they were only sealed in order to spare you any trouble, and if
they were left open you would be able to judge the facts for yourself, inasmuch as the letters
are sometimes lengthy over small points of trade-accounts.

I am glad that you are writing at once to Londonderry via Dublin, for I cannot understand
what is hindering me from getting letters from there.

I do not know if] sent you the invoice of the iron in the Beer, or a note accompanying that
for the Halve Maen, saying that it is an old Swedish ship. Bex writes me that he has so far
loaded 550 slb of iron in the ship Fortuyn and that he is expecting about 3.000 bars which I
suppose the Pyper will take aboard, if it is going to London. How much voyage iron there is
in these two last-named ships I do not know yet. The Halve Maen as well as the Fortuyn are
ships built in Sweden. The Beer was built here but has been a Swedish ship for 8 or 9 years, so I
hope these three ships will encounter no difficulty.

then we have received your letters of the 11th and 25th past and the 2nd instant, wherein we
see that you have settled the suit with the insurers to pay 70 per cent, payable by the 26th of
November. That is good news, and we shall expect from you a brief account of the
settlement.

God be praised for the safe arrival of Alexander Davidson, though it is to be feared that
none of the others has yet come to shelter. However, we hope they have appeared by the time
you receive this.

You say that you see no chance of ships bought in Holland being granted freedom, since
the Resident, Lord Leyonbergh, put in a memorial to the King’s Council about it and got the
answer that the laws of the land had to be obeyed. Nevertheless it is to be hoped that, with the
help of the recent letter from the General College of Commerce, the Resident will obtain it.
Had the English Resident here? not so firmly assured the College of Commerce of it we
would not have despatched the ships thither.

You also say that other people have been loading substantial quantities of pitch and tar
which have arrived in England, and you tell us you would have been obliged if we had
forewarned you about the amounts we had sold to other people for despatch thither—to
which we say that not a single last has been sold for despatch. We cannot find that any tar has
been sent from here, but pitch certainly has, of which we have previously advised you. We
would be glad if you would tell us the captains’ names and to whom the goods were sent.

Herein we send the bill of lading of Capt. Hendrick Hoyer of the ship De Groene Jager,
destined for Hull and consigned to Mr William Skinner with 57 lasts and 4 tuns of tar and 30
lasts of pitch. Please give further orders to Mr Skinner, and herein is a letter for Mr Skinner
which you will please give him.

Mr Thuen has written to you that you should undercut your rivals’ low prices, which is
our view also, because if these people are allowed to undermine us they will finally get on top
and domineer, so we think it is best to anticipate them and deprive them of the opportunity.
Please handle it carefully.

Capt. Oloff Ericksen of the ship Halve Maen, which we have mentioned before, is now
ready and has on board 12 lasts of pitch and 31 lasts 5 tuns of tar. Please procure insurance on
him and on Hendrick Hoyer, according to contract.

Mr Simons has written to you that he must pay RD 6.000 for us and that he has to draw
that amount on you, but there is still some time to run so we have written to him to delay a
little. For those amounts which he has already drawn on you and which you have accepted,
please honour them, but we had not intended to burden you before the arrival of the ships.

You will have learned from our previous letters that we have been unable to find the Lord
Treasurer? at home in order to present him with your bill of exchange. By our next we hope
to be able to tell you if he will accept it, though we fear payment will follow only slowly, but
we will carnestly press it and on receiving it place it on your account. But you have valued the
rixdollar too high—it ought to be only 4s 6d as the exchange with Hamburg does not yield any more. Remaining, &c.",,A. LETTERS TO CHARLES MARESCOE,DUTCH,1668,24 OCTOBER 1668,23 Nov. 1668,27 Nov. 1668,,632,,

iron in the Beer since I had been informed that his ship was also Dutch-built. I understood that
any ships which had been acquired by Sweden by 1662 or thereabouts were regarded as free,
as if they had been built in Sweden, but that any bought subsequently were not. I shall be glad

herewith enclose the second bill of exchange for D.500, in case the first is lost. We hope to
remit you the remainder by our next. We have made a note of the 20 sacks of pepper laden
for your account in the ships Gratia and Vrede, departing from Amsterdam, and of the 100
pieces of lead on the William & Elizabeth, half for your account and half for your brother-in-
law, Mr John Lethieullier, from whom we have received the bill of lading. May the Lord
bring them in safety. We shall not fail to press for the highest price possible. Lead is now
offered at D.50 on delivery and for prompt delivery at D.503, but falling, for there are daily
more enticements to buy so that I fear there will be a further decline as this is also the deadest
season of the year for sales. Pepper is still being held at D.150, because there is not much in
town. If the Gratia arrives early I still hope to find a good market, but with one thing and
another I may not be able to do such good business. The Lantsman, according to the latest letters,
has not yet arrived at Leghorn—I mean, Ancona. Indeed, he delays too long and [---]
must be taken. May the Lord protect him from mishap. Likewise with the Enropa, whose
departure from Leghorn you will have seen in my last letter. As for the sale of lead, I cannot
say if it has been well done so far because, as yet, there is no better prospect to be hoped for. If
it should increase further in England it may well go the same way here: one must hope so. As
for that which has just been laden in Amsterdam, and which will have to fetch a better price if
it is not to produce a loss, I assure you that it will be dealt with as if it were my own.
English tin still remains here at the price of D.32 per hundred-weight (corresponding to
that of lead). If not too much more arrives we are of the opinion that it will remain at that
price, Zante currants were being held at R. pta. 40, Cephalonian at R. pta. 35 to the first
buyer, with the likelihood of not falling as there are still two or three ships to go there to load.
It will be possible to lade the new Apulian oil next month at D.134 per salm, for casks on

board. The Jolin & Thomas departed last Monday. The Merchant’s Delight has been prevented

good health and have found all my people likewise well, praise be to God who protects us.

I now find myself owing you an answer to your letters of the oth, 23rd and 30th of
October—but that of the 16th, in which you sent the account of the 1.064 coils of wire, 76
chests of copper bars and 349 Hungary plates, has not yet come to my hand, so I shall await a
copy as well as a sale-account of the above-mentioned goods. I have received the account of
the 50 cases of stecl: I shall check it and debit you accordingly. It is very welcome news that
Petersen Muller has arrived safely. I hope the other two ships from Gotland will also arrive
soon and that their timber will find a good market.

I see that Jacob Grys is not permitted to unload his pitch and tar in [London]: for what
reason, I would very gladly learn. I saw also that you were offered £5 16s for the remaining
latten and that you sold it for £5 18s. I urge you to you to do your best for my brass and
copper as if it were your own and that, if possible, you get it sold before the winter, because I
can send a new lot in the spring. With the remaining bars you should bide your time and take
care only to dispose of the small parcel of copper-wire rods. It is good garcopper of a kind
which you can no longer get and without it one cannot make bars. I hope it will sell well. As
all the ships are going to [Guinea?] it is not advisable to sell the bars at £5 15s or even £6. Itis
better to bide your time. I have noted what is happening to iron.

You have now paid all the drafts from the Messrs Van Baerle. I would like a clear
statement of how much you think you will have at your disposal on my account from now
on, for my information.

The sample of kettles which you sent with Matthys Meyer has not yet appeared in
Stockholm. As soon as they arrive I shall let you know whether or not I can get them made,
though I think I can, and you will have my thanks. I want to know how much they cost and I
will place it to your credit. At 7s per cwt. the calamine is no use to me.

You can expect two more ships from Gotland laden with beams and planks. They will also
have a quantity of sandstone of the kind we use in this country to ornament our houses as
chimney-pieces or fireplaces. I have ordered the captains to take it aboard as ballast beneath
the timber. If there is anything to be done with it I could deliver a great quantity. It was
selling in Holland by the foot at 18, 19 and 20 stuivers per square foot, but while freight-rates
are so high one cannot get as much for it as one ought, for it should cost at least 25 to 26
stuivers per foot. I shall be glad to learn what happens. If there should be any major buildings,
such as churches or mansions, being constructed in [London] and if one could make a contract
for a large quantity I would agree to it even if it were for as much as 30 or 40 ship-loads,
provided that they unload it. I could supply it, free-on-board, at 12 RD per 100 square feet
and at [London] sell the best at 2 RD, provided that the buyer paid for the importing and
expenses in [London]. You could look into it with this trial offer and Iet me know your
views.

I hear that large amounts of sheet-iron are being forged in Hamburg this year and sent to
[London]. I beg you to let me know how much it may be selling for, what size and weight it
is, and if further amounts are being demanded, for I could deliver a good quantity if there
were some profit to be made by it. And I want you also to inquire if it has been decided in
[England] to have a copper coinage made, and if so, whether one could not deliver a quantity
of copper blanks. Please find out, in secret, and let me know about it. One could earn a substantial commission on a commodity like that. Wherewith, my heartiest regards, &c.",,A. LETTERS TO CHARLES MARESCOE,DUTCH,1668,23 NOVEMBER 1668,18 Dec. 1668,24 Dec. 1668,,771,,

order for some. Every shop and corner is full-up here and none sold, so for the moment there
is no lack of it. Once the season for galls is over they should become cheaper. There is little to
be said about other goods. £32 10s for oil is still too dear: it will have to be cheaper before I

think you might spend something on getting it freed. I hope it will not happen, but if it
should I herewith give you orders to spend something on procuring its freedom to be
imported and unloaded, so that they can be sold. It must not be risked with a severe freeze-up;
just wait long enough until something is decided, in case it does not freeze at all. There are
250 chests altogether, with the accompanying mark, loaded aboard the ship St Jean Battista,

and sold (as above) to my best advantage.

Herewith is an order to the master, and if that is not enough you can write to Jacomo

bought a fodder of leade under £12 per fodder. However, because I wold not alwayes ride

mainly to accompany the bill of lading of Slb. 160.19.11 of wire and Slb. 31.5.13 of Hungary
plates consigned to you aboard Gerret Laurens, which I hope you have received. Since then
the ship has departed and as it had a following wind I hope, with God’s help, it has arrived in
[England]. Furthermore, Mr Hansen has returned from England, assuring me that you have
shown yourself very favourably inclined to administer my affairs over there, and as I should
be very glad to see all the Swedish commissions together in one hand I have asked him to send
you my views and the conditions on which I want to correspond,(1) I trust he has done so and
that you have accepted them, for none of my friends in Holland, Hamburg and France refuse
them. And although I have addressed a consignment to you before I can receive your answer,
I trust that I shall nonetheless be treated generously by you, which will give me grounds for
continuing with even bigger commissions.

You yourself know that at these miserable prices for wire there are losses, but that if it all
came into one person’s hands it could be held in better esteem. I beg you to do this, and not to
let it go for less than £5 12s or £5 10s. As for [copper] plate, since it usually fetches a good
price, please sell it at the current price because I do not doubt it will be fixed at £6 10s. Let the
captain keep the bill of lading if he has it, but the other, endorsed by me, is to be handed over;
and have the empty casks of steel delivered to Messrs Burkin & Evertsen.

It would be friendly service to me if one could, quietly and securely, conclude an
agreement with the East India Company for a considerable quantity of copper. Tell me what
you think, in confidence, and also what you have heard from the Resident, Leyonbergh,
about my case concerning the plundered galliot called de Paerel—whether anything is
coming of it or not. You could easily inquire and assure yourself that it is being handled as it
should be, I await your advice concerning the prices of our Swedish commodities and your counsel concerning next Spring’s cargoes, and send herewith, cordial greetings, &c.

Gotland and have put everything in order on both islands, so I only need a favourable wind to
complete my journey back to Sweden—God grant me a speedy voyage!

This letter serves mainly to say that I have, lying here in Slite harbour, two Dutch ships
which came from Portugal with salt. The ships are called De Hartogh (of which Claes Jacobs is
captain) and the St Margreta (captain, Cornelis Jacobsen) and I am having them loaded with
timber, such as large and small beams, planks and firewood. I am also putting some limestone
inas ballast, just as an experiment. Very fine lime can be burned. You could enquire if there is
any chance of selling it: for your information, one can get three tons of lime from one ton of
limestone. You will be hearing from Mr Jacob Kroes how much it costs. As for the timber
which is coming in the above-mentioned ships, you will find it much better timber than any
from the Baltic or Norway. Indeed, an English builder assured me that it was as good as any
northern or Dutch oak. You will find it to be mostly of large beams, over one foot thick in
diameter, so I am hopeful it will sell for much more than it did last year. I am relying on you
to do your utmost with them.

I am also expecting at Klintchamn two large ships from Holland which will also be loaded
for [London] with extremely fine timber. They will be consigned to you and I do not doubt
that you will seck my profit. Please pay the freight charges to the aforesaid captains according
to the account which Jacob Kroes will send you if he writes to you. If the timber-ware should
fall short of the balance due on the freight (which I hope it will not) I shall make provision for
you from Sweden, I am relying on you, and if the timber sells well and if Dutch ships can
freely come to [England] with such goods next year I am thinking of sending 10 to 12 ships- lading of timber. May the Lord God grant you good health, &c.

datse niet moogen meester speelen.’","Since our latest letter of the 28th past we have received yours of the 13th ditto, which we
ought to have had eight days earlier. This week’s ordinary post has also not arrived.

We have noted that Resident Leyonbergh has been unable to achieve anything, although
he has done his duty in trying to procure freedom for the ships, and that captain Johanson was
ready to depart for Rochelle although the Resident still had hopes of obtaining his freedom,
which would be very welcome to us as we would rather not send the goods to Rochelle
where there is already so much that they will not be sold for a long while. It is a good thing
that you are summoning the St Pieter from Yarmouth, because our friends from Hull and
Yarmouth have written that so much tar and pitch from others has arrived that it will not be
sold in a year. We beg you to seize every opportunity to dispose of our goods at whatever
price they will fetch so that foreign competitors are thwarted and not allowed to dominate
the market. We shall now wait to hear of further developments.

From the accompanying extract you will be able to see how much Mr Simons has
accepted for us and when the amounts fall due. We have made out a short account showing
how much we can draw on you according to contract against the goods we have sent you,
being in total 404 lasts and 6 barrels of tar and 170 lasts and 8 barrels of pitch (besides the three
consignments which have to go to Rochelle and with which you can now no longer be ofany
service to us) rated according to contract at £5 per last for the tar and £8 per last for the
pitch, making a total of £3.384 from which is deducted the £1.300 which Simons has
already drawn. That leaves £2.084 to be made good, followed by the £2.000 which you
have promised to furnish in the spring, altogether totalling £4.084 which we have ordered
Mr Simons to draw on you in the month of February next or whenever the said bills fall due
at 2 or 4 usances. We beg you to be so kind as to accept his drafts for that amount and we trust
that the goods will easily yield that much and more—but in case they do not we shall save
you from any loss by sending you at the first opportunity in the new year a sufficient quantity
from which you can reimburse yourself. We await your favourable response to this, never
doubting in the least that you will assist us, and request that you correspond with Mr Simons about it. In the meanwhile may God bless and protect you.

[P.S.] The moment we finished this we immediately received your letter of the 20th past
with the sale account of goods from Hans Teunissen and Alexander Davidson which we will
have checked over, let you know our findings and then record our agreement. We were sorry
to see that Lord Leyonbergh was unable to procure freedom for the ships and that the Beata
and St Anna have also departed for Rochelle. We greatly regret that. We had always had high
hopes that their freedom would be obtained. These hopes are now dashed. We had also
hoped to have the benefit of the proceeds, but that also cannot be done, so we beg you to
honour our drafts of £4.084 according to plan. You said you had to guarantee security of
£2.000 for the Suyderstrom and asked us not to draw anything against it. We hope—and
recently we have had assurance—that its freedom will be obtained, and the captain also
writes that ship and goods could be freed on payment of £150. Nevertheless, we shall
guarantee you against any loss and provide your collateral security. The Salt Company will
do likewise for their share of the ship and goods. It is good that the cargo from Jolle Tiersen
has been mostly sold and that you can see your way to disposing of the remainder from the
Suyderstrom. Please sell it for whatever it will fetch. God willing, we shall send you a
consignment as soon as the waters are open again and in order to do so have already chartered
all the necessary ships. With regard to the matter of the court-judgement we shall see what
happens. We shall also see to it that the Resident gets another letter to spur him on which we

This serves to inform you that in September last I loaded in the Phoenix (Capt. Robert Clark,
an Englishman) bound from here to Venice, 10 bales of pepper, bearing the mark adjoining,
and 512 pieces of campeachy wood which weighed here 15.733 lb., as well as a quantity of
iron cannon-balls. I now learn that the said captain struck on the Goodwins and, having
suffered some damage, ran into Dover where he unloaded the whole ship and wrote to the
interested parties here asking for remittance of his expenses, which it is said will run high. So
my request to you asa friend is, that you will immediately write to your friend at Dover to
discover what costs he has incurred and to urge him to have some regard for my goods. As for
paying the costs of unloading and reloading, that can hardly be done unless a proper division
is made, and I would judge it best that the captain tries to borrow the money and leaves the
division of costs until he has delivered in Venice. Meanwhile, since it will be undoubtedly a
long voyage and I understand that pepper is fetching high prices in England I would be glad
to see you receive the 10 bales of pepper and also the campeachy wood lying at Dover,
agreeing with the captain for half the freight or, failing that, paying the whole freight and
keeping the expenses as low as possible. And if you can sell the pepper for 23d or 24d [p. lb.
and the campeachy wood at about 50s [p. cwt.] please do it, and also find out how much that
type of cannon-ball fetches in England. I am sending you herewith the bill of lading, the

who is now on the ship, called Henrig de Valet, who I am urging to persuade the captain to
follow your advice in all matters, as I trust he will do. There was also loaded here in the said
ship a small barrel of cardamon marked ‘P.B.’ which the captain said, on signing the bill of
lading, he had not found. Please inquire if it has now been found in the process of unloading;
if so, it can be sent on to Venice. I beg you to forgive me for giving you this trouble, and
please do your best to serve me, urging your trusted friend at Dover neither to lose the bill of
lading nor to fill it in before it is known what the captain will allow to be done with the
goods. I am also sending herewith the bill of lading for the cannon-balls in case you need it
and it seems a good idea not to reload them. I know very well that such goods as pepper and
[campeachy] wood are not allowed to be imported into England from here; however, I hope
that in this regard no notice will be taken and that you will know just how far one can go.

Sir, as I found the cotton you sent reasonably good, excepting one bag which was very
dirty inside, I herewith request you that if there is no prospect of further decline in that sort
you will, at your convenience, look for similarly good cotton and if you can encounter a
quantity which is clean and white to be had for 6d to 64d then get me another 15 to 20 sacks of
Smyrna, as well as 10 of Cyprus, cotton—and if such clean and white stuff is to be had at 65d
or 62d please buy it and send it at the first opportunity in the spring. Above all, you must
procure good quality, which can be done very conveniently since there is no prospect of a
price rise. I can see no opportunity here for poor quality, for your information.",,A. LETTERS TO CHARLES MARESCOE,DUTCH,1669,8 JANUARY 1669,18 Jan. 1669,22 Jan. 1669,,675,,

learn of Capt. Anders Beursen’s arrival with my iron, which doubtless has been correctly
delivered.

When I mentioned increased costs in my letters I was not referring to ordinary expenses
such as brokerage and suchlike, but was thinking that I shall have to carry the costs of selling
goods to reliable people and bear the discount on good money—that is to say, quaet gelt(1). I
will gladly bear any loss, whether it arises in [England] or here, and I understand perfectly
well the difference between exchange and current money. If my goods were sold on such
terms I must be satisfied with them. Regarding the sale of my iron with a rebate of 8 per
cent—I will gladly grant that, if you will stand liable for bad debts, but I think it is too risky
for me to bear bad debts in return for 6 per cent rebate on goods sold at 6 months time. God
knows, I have had my share of bad debts in [London] and the effects of the great Fire of
[London] begin to emerge now as in cases such as Scherley(2) and may yet be revealed more
fully with time. Consequently, one must be careful to whom one sells.

The £150 @ 35s 10g on Amsterdam remitted to Mr Bex for my account on 2 October at
double usance drawn on John Lodge & Co has been accepted. I trust payment will follow, for
which I have credited your account.

I urge you to sell my iron which has come with Beursen to reliable people. As there is no
fitting-out taking place in [England](3) demand is very small, so one must wait and see. I have
had a lot of inquiries after Beursen’s iron from the English here but I did not want to let it get
into other hands. Please let me know in due course how things turn out with Scherley. Our
Company is owed quite a lot, as you well know, which the partners find strange.

wrote, has since arrived in the Texel with this favourable wind and the cargo has come to a
profitable market at Amsterdam, for which God must be thanked, for I was not a little afraid
that it would be frozen in. For the last 14 days the ice has been melting so that the Elbe is
nearly entirely free of it, and yesterday the mussel-fishers started coming up again.

I have been glad to see what Barbados sugar has been doing [in London]. The price of 27s is
still too high for me and since it seems likely to rise in [England] there is nothing to be done
with it here in the near future because there are too large amounts in too many hands of
people who would be glad to sell at 62 to 63g. But little is disposed of because our leading
sugar-refiners provided themselves before the winter with such large stocks that for 6 months
or more there will be no shortage. Consequently, unless its price weakens in [London] there
will be few orders from Amsterdam or from here. However, if it should show signs of falling
to 245 or 245 6d please buy 15.000 to 20.000 lb. and send it to me. If you draw on me for the
requisite funds at once, due honour will be done to your bills, but above all see to it that it is

being so cheap with you it would not be advisable for it to come here as there is no demand
for it. Oil was falling to £29 with you: if you can get some clear, sweet Apulian oil which has
freshly arrived you can buy me 6 or 7 barrels, but take good care that there is no dirt in itand
that there has been nothing strong or bitter-tasting in the casks before. I would prefer you to

proceeds of the 4 casks of pans and kettles which came with Claes Scholts amounted to
£251 14s,and that the 3 chests of latten, 4 casks of pans and kettles and one cask of pots which
came with Willem Muller yielded £440 4s 8d. As for the remaining copper rods and sheet-
copper from J[acob] M[omma] as well as the copper-wire from W[illem] M[omma] please
dispose of as much as possible if the price recovers. We wait to learn if the 4 casks of W.M.’s
pots which came with Andries Jornson have been sold. We shall postpone drawing on you
for J.M.’s account until next month and then not more than £500 to £600 sterling in all, and
if we can manage it we shall entirely forego drawing and expect you at your convenience to
make remittances for our friends in good bills. However, it is very awkward for us to be out
of pocket for so long on account of the money we have advanced upon these goods since the
amount is so large.

Herewith goes the account of the 40 barrels of tin received with Simon van Houten, of
which the net proceeds amount to f.6.196.12s bank-money. We have placed it to your
current account. Please check it over and if you find no errors please approve it. We will not
sell your remaining tin for less than f.58 until further order. So far no buyers have come
forward for the galls although we have several times commissioned brokers. We shall
continue to do so whenever we see the Opportunity.

We have made inquiry with Peter Simons’ book-keeper as well as in the Bank to learn if
the £250 sterling bill of exchange of 1/11 January at 36s with double usance drawn by you
for the benefit of Jacob Cornelisen and endorsed to Widow Forkenbeck had been enrolled as
he said it had been when he wrote to you on the 12th inst., but from both we received the
answer that it had not been done. So, according to your request, we have today paid the sam
to the aforesaid Widow Forkenbeck by declaration before a notary that it had been done for
the honour of the drawer, as appears in the deed accompanying the bill of exchange and
protest sent herewith, amounting with interest and expenses (according to the enclosed

account from Forckenbeck) to: f.2.708.16.00

We have today drawn on you £256 2s 6d sterling, payable at 2 usances to Gerard Weymans,
the value of Michiel Gerard junior, which you will please honour and set against the aforesaid
amount. We have also told Abraham Bex and Jan Aries Snoeck that we will pay the £110 @
36s 3g and the £44 4s 4d @ 36s on the date due, for which amount with expenses we will
also draw on you. The above-mentioned Simons has left for Sweden and has written to
someone that he will be back within two months and will give everyone satisfaction. We too
were of the opinion that he did no business on his own account but we now find it was
otherwise and that he carried on a trade with Portugal, as well as with Sweden, in salt. In
addition, during the war, he had taken shares in various Swedish ships with all of which he
made no profit. Yet he has advanced about f. 100.000 to various people in Sweden, for which
he expected goods in the spring, and as he had no means of his own he had to use other
people’s money; and a broker whom he was accustomed to use failing not long ago several
amounts were called in and seeing that he could get no credit to make good the amounts
which were drawn by him on Frankfort (being about 44.000) he decided to depart. His
outstanding loans and assets nearly balance his liabilities, being about 200.000, but in the
latest letters from Sweden it is said he has had orders from the Tar Company to draw £2.000
sterling on you. We do not doubt that you enter into Swedish obligations carefully enough,
but we have been asked to believe that you yourself sometimes stand burdened with £4.000
to £5.000 on account of the Tar Company over and above the value of the effects you have
in your hands, which we cannot credit.

Herewith we return the bills of exchange for £200 and £100 accepted by Daniel Planck.
The £100 on Van Racy remains still without acceptance for the reasons we explained in our

continue to have poor sales here and buyers still want things cheaper than they can be offered
from [England], so for the present I have decided to wait and see. I have heard from others
that one will be able to get new Barbados sugar for 23s, which I could well pay, but for the
moment they want it cheaper here and it is believed that still larger amounts are daily
expected from there, as well as other wares such as cottons, ginger, indigo, etc. The latter
commodity remains quiet here, but with the latest Spanish letters they write they have had
news that the English—I mean to say, the French—have taken over St Domingo,’ which I
can hardly believe, although it seems that that nation, as well as the English, have been set on
one scheme or another against the Spanish, and asa consequence there could be some change
coming in indigo. If you can get earlier information of any such I shall be glad to share it. I
shall also be glad to learn what kinds of commodities the ships from Jamaica bring and also if
campeachy-wood comes with them. Straits wares are also in as bad repute here as those of
Barbados, likewise East Indian which, when the expected ships arrive in [England] as well as
Holland, are likely to fall much further. If any commissions come with the ships that have
arrived from Livorno I shall be glad to learn what they fetch. Galls are not required from

I have received the 30 sacks of cotton out of Harmen Vilter and found them good. It is
lamentable that all goods, lacking vent, are at low prices and nothing can be sold at a profit.
The English nation undersells goods too much. Here is a quantity of Smyrna cotton selling
at 12g, though rather bad; Apulian oil—as 3 English ships have come adrittura—is selling at
RD 63; s0 there is no profit to be got by ordering these commodities from England. I myself
have bought 40 rixdollars-worth of it here in order to keep it.

I note what you write about the iron in the Fortuna and will be very glad to learn that you
have sold it at a good price. You say that the iron-buyers are holding back because of the
prospect of more ships coming shortly from here with iron. That may well be, and every year
large amounts do come from here, and ifonly the shipments were held by you the iron would
not weaken so much, especially if it mostly came into strong hands. I wish it could be
arranged,

I have chartered for [London] Capt. Jacob Giese of the ship Den Grooten Christoffel which
now lies ready to sail, and have loaded therein—according to the four bills of lading enclosed:

so [ hope it will find a good market. I have ordered Jean & David van Baerle to see to the
insurance and have also given them order to draw RD 5.000 on you for my account at 1 or 2

instant by which I see you have bought for me at 4s 6d p. lb rather more Barbados indigo
than I ordered because your friend did not want to break up the consignment. I expect you to
send it at the earliest opportunity since in the meantime yet more may arrive from Barbados,
and if you can then get good quality stuff for 4s 3d or 4s 4d you may buy me another 600 to
7oo lb. and send it here at once. Regarding the sugar, if it docs not fall to about 21s there is
nothing to be done, but if it should come to that price you may buy me 12.000 to 15.000 lb.
and send it here at the earliest opportunity, making sure that it is good stuff. I shall not tie you
down to 6d more or less, except that at 22s buy only 12.000 lb.

Since galls at present fetch only sos [flem.I here they can hardly be brought from
[England], and as those which were expected from the Levant do not seem likely to come to
50s there are a large quantity standing here unsold. I have no news of what prices oil is
fetching in Apulia but from Marseille they write me that they daily expect it to be cheaper. In
Spain that commodity is also good.

For your information, there is an English ship here from Venice and Zante with currants
and other goods—and for all wares there is poor consumption. As now and then some
opportunity turns up at Bristol to do something in one commodity or another J wonder if in
such case I may take the liberty of drawing £200 or £300 on you from there so that you can draw back on me, because there is no direct exchange from here on that place. With cordial

could not do better you might lay out 4s 8d for 600 lb. of fine Barbados indigo, provided that
there was no news that the flota had arrived in Spain with indigo and that a ship was on the
point of sailing here. We cancelled the commission for Ardasse; this we now confirm. We
have since received your letter of the 9th inst., together with the account of the 10 butts of
sugar sent with Capt. Willem Oloffsen and now received. We shall look it over and, finding
no errors, will record our agreement. We have examined the weight in the casks and we find
it turns out reasonably well, but we shall lose Soo lb. by the tare of the butts. The sugar suits us
well except that 2 butts turn out to be not so white as the other 8; that is our opinion. If we
write to you for white and fine stuff you may get us something similar to the 8 butts in this
consignment which have turned out to be white without any brown or rusty stuff amongst it.
Please do not hesitate to pay 6d more, but for 1s more it must be extra-choice. Do your best
for us. Another friend writes us with this post that great quantities of sugar are expected from
Barbados, and the more it declines in price the better you will be able to obtain it. Do your
best, because the profits between here and [England] are very meagre. Thus, if you can find
an entirely fine batch you may buy us ro or 12 butts and send it here. We shall see if we can
remit you a sum at short sight by the next post; if not, you may draw the amount on us and
your bills will be duly honoured as has been the £150 sterling which you drew on us at
2 usances for the sugar, to pay to the order of Marselis van der Hulst.

We shall be glad to hear what further happens to this commodity as well as your opinion
about pepper. We are glad that you have bought us 24 sacks of Barbados cotton, big and
small, at 4 3/4d [p. lb.]. We shall expect the account and your drafts. There is nothing to be done
with it here at present and if more comes from [England] it must decline further, for there is
no consumption. We hope that you have not bought us any Ardasse for it has fallen greatly
here from 19s to 17s within 3 weeks. Therefore, please do not buy us any for we could make
no profit with it.

If you buy Barbados indigo please see to it that it is saleable and of high quality, because
weak, blue stuff is not required—for your information. As long as galls are unobtainable in
[London] for 46s or 47s it is no use thinking about them for the quantity here is too great and

they are very cheap. If any changes occur in [London] please communicate with us.

barrels of fine blue-dye. Since then I have received yours of the 16th past together with the
sale-account concerning the 20 barrels of ordinary, and 8 of fine, blue-dye, which I have
examined and found correct. You put down commission at 2 per cent but I hope in future
you will be satisfied with 13 per cent, as on purchases, because the profit we make on this is
rather meagre.

I see you are unloading the 3 barrels of arsenicum, though you do not expect to sell it for
more than 20s since it is a very poor commodity in [England]. I know perfectly well that a
large quantity will not sell. I frequently sell quantities to Englishmen here who send it
themselves to [London], paying here for the purchase f.103 or f-11; they must then pay here
for an export licence and in [England] for its import, so if they can only sell for 20s they must
be very foolish. You must try to get the most you can.

According to what you write sugar must now be at its lowest, and I would be favourably
inclined to buy some, partly in order to dispose of the last lot I got from you—which is still
unsold—at a somewhat lower price, and partly in order to mix that with somewhat better
quality to make it appear more respectable for sale. But because of the way you served me last
time I am very apprehensive, fearing to get bad quality instead of good. If you can do better
and obtain extra-good quality at 24s, then buy 30.000 to 40.000 lb., but get nothing other
than the very choicest for as I have already said it is only to serve to improve the appearance of
the other lot.! If you cannot get it to your satisfaction you must let it wait as it does not
necessarily have to be done today. You can distribute it in 2 or 3 ships and lade them here at
the earliest opportunity. I urge you most strongly to procure only the best quality, and see
that in weighing it my prescribed weights are observed.

You indicated ginger to be at 48s. If you can obtain good quality at that price, free on
board, please buy 8.000 to 10.000 lb. and send it here also. Cubeb, I understand, are selling at
£6 tos in [London]. If they can still be had for that you may also undertake the purchase of
1.000 or 1.200 lb. Six ships have returned safely to this country from the Indies, namely four

received yours of the 11th ditto and noted the contents, to which my answer briefly follows.

I have seen what you write about timber and I shall be happy to participate in whatever
may develop. I would be glad to learn if something could be done to procure passes, for we
have rather a lot of timber lying on Gotland which cannot be got to [England] for lack of
shipping space but which otherwise could come this year if one could get passes.

The price at which you have sold the iron from the Fortuna I have noted, as well as the
price at which you say the English are selling the iron which has come this year. They will get
little profit by it as I believe it will begin to cost more here. It is lamentable that such an
imperishable commodity should be undersold, and if they continue to conduct themselves in
this way in [England] while large amounts are still coming things will go badly this year, for I
see that much has been shipped from here, but I trust that it comes into firm hands and
remains there at a good price.

You will have learned from my previous letter what I have sent to you, and I hope the ship
is now well out to sea—God bring him soon in safety. I have also noted the price of copper-
wire, copper-sheets and rods, and it will serve for my guidance. Swedish-built ships to carry
timberware from Gotland are not to be had here, and are also too expensive to charter. I shall
expect the account of the iron from the Fortuna at the earliest opportunity. I am sorry to hear
from Amsterdam that Peter Simons’ affairs turn out quite differently from what he told me
here. He wrote to me on the 25th past and has begged me to beg you to sign the agreement
with him as he will always try to satisfy you. I ask you to oblige him as far as you can, not
doubting that he will be grateful.

I have consigned to you in the following ships iron as follows:

779 bars—Slb. 103.11;

Clopstock, Klunder and Swen Rassmussen. We would have loaded more iron in the St Anna
but because of contrary winds it has not arrived. By our next letter we will advise what other
batches you can expect from here and from Gothenburg.

Concerning the delivery of copper of which you were thinking, we are not much inclined
to it and cannot make up our minds as copper is very dear here and at the price you
mentioned it would render a poor account. It is rising daily so that one can make no firm
estimate. We can probably do better by selling our wares here.

We were very surprised to learn of the serious situation of Mr Simons’ affairs in
Amsterdam. He had informed us otherwise when he was here, and we have learned nothing
else from him than that he had reached agreement with Mr Abraham Momma about how
you were to be reimbursed. We now hear the contrary. Since he had so many claims on the
Tar Company here he should have been able to obtain the necessary means, and we are
heartily sorry that you are so deeply involved. God knows, we would have watched out
better for you if we had known. You can expect a good quantity of iron from Gothenburg, although it is taking so long that one gets weary. Cordial regards, &c.

Regarding what you proposed concerning a person who approached you about a
consignment of garcopper and ‘Hungary plates’, without specifying the quantity, and for
which you quoted him the price of £5 14s for the garcopper and £6 for the Hungary
plates—in reply to which, I could not easily deliver it to [London] for less if I am to gain
anything by it. Coppers have risen here because those abroad, as in Holland and Hamburg,
are also somewhat raised in price. As a result, I cannot afford to take less, and that for cash
down or within 1 month of delivery, and you should please be prepared to allow me to draw
on you at double usance for at least three-quarters of the value of the cargo as soon as the bill
of lading has been sent. If your friend can agree to these terms he can order as much as he
pleases—but he must answer at once, otherwise the copper-markct here will be over and it
will be too late in the year to send anything out, for winter is nearly upon us. We shall
therefore await your, or your friend’s, decision, but if we wait much longer nothing can be
done before the winter.

Concerning my remaining wire, I urge you most strongly to dispose of it at the first
opportunity, but I cannot agree to let it go for less than £5 8s or £5 9s.

Coppers rise here daily and look likely to rise still higher, so I shall have very little profit on
the above-written conditions. If the market does not alter and I am to make a start I must
quickly get moving.(2) Please let me know in reply to this the quantity of rods which
[England] can consume yearly and at what times they are most in demand.

Messrs Pels complain that you had their £200 bill of exchange protested on the grounds
that they had drawn £30 or more than I had given order for. I am greatly astonished for I
never imagined that they had gone over the limit, and even if they had you might well have
considered that it would not happen again and that I would have acknowledged the amount
for my account. I trust that for the present there will be enough time to procure payment of
 the amount. I urge you most strongly not to treat those gentlemen’s bills with disrespect. Iremain, &c.",,A. LETTERS TO CHARLES MARESCOE,DUTCH,1669,21 JULY 1669,14 Aug. 1669,24 Aug. 1669,,450,,

serve to assure you of my keenness to correspond with you. My brother had the honour of
saluting you in [London] about one-and-a-half years ago with my cousin, Dominicus
Juncker, and to inquire if we could establish a regular correspondence between us. I have been
greatly inclined to get a good quantity of Barbados sugar, but only of the finest and best
quality of the sort you provided for my nephew Paul Berenberg. In procuring the purchase
make sure it is at a reasonable price and in the right condition—especially if it reaches 22s or,
at most, 23s. Also Barbados cotton at 4-pence and good Aleppo gall-nuts at 45-46s, as a
friend of mine says he has had, which are likely to be 46s. Please also tell me how much nice,
dry English leather is fetching. Here it is at a very low price and I am sure it can only be at 6d
in [England].

For some time I have been selling a good deal of linen alamodes to the English here, which is
apparently sent to Barbados and the colonies. Please find out in [London] how much a piece
of 70 ells, 7/4 broad, would fetch, a sample of which is here enclosed and which I can have made
in all kinds of fashions. If you also had the opportunity to dispose of about 100 barrels of tin,
of the mark of the Horse, which is the best sort, I could provide it. If you cannot reach
agreement in [London] you could take the tin barrels, which are RD 21 (I say, one and
twenty) free on board, and set against them a delivery of sugars and Barbados cotton (which
must be entirely good) and I shall set against it as much money as the tin is worth and you
could take the commission on both the tin and the sugars. I have arranged to do so with a
friend here and it has worked out well. I would at once send you the 100 barrels of tin and
remit you RD 2.000 which would at least provide for the above-said sugars.

2 ‘Engelse goedingh stangh iser’.","The foregoing, dated the 21st past, is a copy of my last letter, to which I refer you. I have since
received yours of the 25th and 29th of June, and 9th and 30th of July, the contents of which
are fully understood and to which the answer shortly follows herewith.

I have received the account of the iron sold from the Fortuyn and found it correct. I have
debited you with the proceeds, £325 11s 6d and credited you with the RD 140 from my
lord Pistolhielm at 4s 9d each, being £33 5s. The idea that I should be paid here at the rate of
5s 6d is a mistake, for they can be got for no more than 5 10/32. [d.c.m.]

I have seen what you write about the price of iron and other things, and it is annoying that
some dealers should undersell by offering it at £14 per ton on delivery. They achieve nothing
but loss by doing so as they have bought it dearly here. I hope it remains at a good price so
that one will continue to want to send it. I expect to hear in due course.

With regard to what you write about charges on the iron I send to you, you are to
understand it as we have done formerly, namely that for whatever expenditure you incur you
can take interest, and if any losses should occur—which God forbid! it is well-insured and
you will recover your outlay from those gentlemen who have drawn on you for my account,
so you run no risk and there is no need for you to make difficulties. It seems to me rather
strange, what you say you have written to Messrs Van Baerlc, that they should not draw on
you before the ship has reached [London]. If they are to fulfil my drafts on them they must be
able to draw RD 2.500 on you. My request is that you will allow them to draw as much on
youas the proceeds approximately come to, though deducting what you may have advanced
for me already according to the accompanying account. And as regards what has happened, I
have looked into it and find that when the 158 barrels of steel were estimated to be worth
£160(1) you were already about £340 out of pocket. Please let Messrs Van Baerle have any
proceeds arising in excess of that amount. I depend on that as I have charged them with my
drafts and will draw accordingly on future deliveries.

Here inclosed I send 3 bills of lading of iron laden for my account in the ship Mars, captain
Hans Johanson, together amounting to Slb. 872.10, including various sorts of ‘English-style’2
bar-iron and Slb. 117.15.10 of forged band-iron. NB that in future it must be sold at higher
prices, as I have written to you before and to which I refer you. Herewith also is a bill of
lading from Capt. Hendrick Claessen Boender for Slb. 305.15.10 of ‘English-style’ bar iron,
all of which I am consigning to you, and I have another batch which will follow. In selling it I
urge you to have as much regard for my profit as if it were your own: I depend upon it.

I have read what you tell me about Peter Simons and am surprised that you did not write
to meat once about what you let him draw on you. I never thought his affairs would turn out
so badly, and as for me being indebted to him for f.8.00o—I can prove the contrary as he
owes me for Portuguese drafts, so I do not know how I can help you. I do not doubt that he
will try to satisfy you in full, as he has written to me, only you must enter into the agreement with him. God protect each and all from misfortune, &c.",,A. LETTERS TO CHARLES MARESCOE,DUTCH,1669,28 AUGUST 1669,17 Sep. 1669,24 Sep. 1669,,651,,

trade could be brought into a few hands and by that means preserve its reputation. You will
know how to seek the most advantage for my consignments, which remain commended to

As the prospect of bringing some timber to [England] in foreign-built ships and getting
passes for them has faded for the moment, we must let it pass until a better opportunity arises.
I have still about 800 to 1.000 shippounds of iron standing ready which I intend to send in the
ship Jupiter unless some other shipping turns up so that I can divide the consignment, but I
very much hope that it will obtain a better price. At the present price I think it advisable to be
careful with my consignment and wait for some improvement. Then, I beg you, let the
Messrs Van Baerle have what they need for my account. I am of the opinion that iron will not
remain at such a low price, and would also be glad to know your views.

little to be done with a procuration as, so far as I know, he has scarcely any effects here, and to

I have noted what goods of mine still remain with you unsold and hope they will also quickly

It is possible that if shipping-space turns up this autumn I shall send you an assortment of
thicker wire, but since the departure of Capt. Abraham Richart no opportunity of freighting
to [London] has occurred.

I was very glad to learn of Richart’s safe arrival—God be praised! I have further seen what
you say concerning your friend who wants to do business about a consignment of copper,
and that he has offered to take 600 ‘Hungary plates’ and has at last gone so far as to offer
£5 18s payable on delivery be the end of November. You should have learned from
previous letters that I really cannot oblige by sending any quantity of copper to [England] this
year—partly for lack of shipping and partly (and principally) because copper has recently
become so tight and scarce here that it can hardly be got for money. But if your friend will
wait for a consignment to be sent with the first available ships going to [London] from here in
the new year, and if you could persuade your friend to pay you the money now, I would
agree to the price of £5 18s—for your guidance.

My friend, because I have bought these large copper-works I must necessarily take care to
keep my people fully employed, but I have no resources to enable me to supply the
[‘Hungary’] plates unless I can command money at Hamburg. If you will accommodate me
with some money at 6 per cent interest I would probably be able to send you more supplies.
Whether the business of the plates goes forward or not, and as you now have all the Swedish
copper-wire under your hand, I hope you will fix the price rather higher than it has been—I depend on it. I urge you to sell the thick copper-wire rods; wherewith my regards, &c.",,A. LETTERS TO CHARLES MARESCOE,DUTCH,1669,24 SEPTEMBER 1669,19 Oct. 1669,22 Oct. 1669,,438,,

will tell you in our next how much the remittance of RD 500 current-money amounts to in
bank-money. We have been paid the £100 stg. at 355 11g drawn on John Lodge, and have
credited your account.

We are sorry to see that you are in dispute with the Västervik Ship Company. Our friend
at Rotterdam wrote us on the rith instant that he has sold another four 6-pounder cannon at
[f]8: 15(1) on the same terms as the last, and as the guns are old and inferior we consider he has
done well. However, we have since then written to him to hold back from selling fora while,

We have taken expert advice about the sample of cotton but find that it is too coarse for
East Indian yarn and most resembles yarn from the Straits, of which there is at present a
reasonable amount in town. The yarn sold by our East India Company is fine, like the
accompanying sample, and sells at 28 to 27 s[tuivers] per lb. That which was sold at 16 1/2st was
badly made up and as a result it fetched less than others just as fine. But we judge that cotton
yarn which is no coarser than your sample should sell for 16 st per lb., and you will please note
that the finest are the most sought after. Such yarn is mostly used at Haarlem for textiles and
other stuffs,(?) and because little has arrived here this year from the East Indies we believe it
would not do badly if you could find something finer—or certainly not coarser-—than the
sample you sent.

We see that the price of copper-wire has risen somewhat and is likely to continue to do so
as little has been sent to London. We have noted how much of J. R[eenstierna]’s wire has been
sold, and we hope you will soon be able to close the account of W.M[omma]’s copper-wire.
We have procured the necessary acceptance of the £935 12s 2d stg which you remitted to us
in ten bills of exchange for my Lord Jacob Reenstierna’s account and he has been informed of
it.

You wrote to us about remittances being made against A. Reenstierna’s iron on its arrival

arrived Jacob Jacobsen Grys with Slb. 152.14 and Claes Molt with Slb. 636.17, against which
nothing has been remitted. Your next letters will possibly inform us further.

Peter Simons is lying sick in bed. As his settlement has not yet been signed by as many
creditors as are required for it to take effect we suggest that you demand his guarantee in case
the remaining creditors refuse to sign and he is released from his obligations. What happens
next only time will tell.

As you ordered us not to hurry with remittances we shall return your accepted bills of

yours of the 27th past and 3rd instant, by which we are delighted to hear of the arrival of
Thomas Klerck. We hope the Lord will have brought the others in safety. By our last you
should have had the bill of lading of Capt. Erick Fix, his cargo being 327 lasts of tar and 18
lasts of pitch. We have given orders for the insurance thereon, as well as on Hans Johanson
and Anders Krock, and wait to learn the result. Please also take care of the insurance,
according to contract, of Jacob Pieters Potteut’s cargo, being 74 small lasts of tar and 39 lasts
of pitch. Capt. Olof Erickson’s ship will be ready for loading soon, and Nathaniel Fabrius’s
ship is expected from Calmar every hour. We have also chartered the ship Jupiter, Capt. Jacob
Fix, which will be coming in for loading next week. Hans Reyser’s ship was built in an un-
free place so we have not dared to load it.

Meanwhile, Mr Jacob Sempel has procured a recommendation from his Excellency the
English Ambassador for the free export of 150 lasts of pitch, since he has paid the Company
for permission, and the goods are all consigned to you. We have loaded 85 lasts of pitch for
that voyage, for your information.

We have examined the four sale-accounts of tar and pitch and found them correct and
debited you for the proceeds. We shall try our best to send 70 lasts of tar and 10 lasts of pitch
to Yarmouth and 4o lasts of tar and 15 lasts of pitch to the Isle of Wight, but we see no chance
of doing so as there are few native-built ships here and they have all been freighted for
{England] by others; and as long as there is a shortage of goods in London we think it
inadvisable to send them to the small places.

We note that you have been approached by two friends who want to buy 600 lasts of tar
and 200 lasts of pitch to be delivered to them between now and March next, for which they
have offered £84 and £114 respectively, payable in 6 months, with nothing for warchouse
rent—to which you await our answer. We will tell you, then, that we would sooner have the
highest possible price as the warehouses are already hired, and we also hope that the goods
will be in demand in the spring if all the necessary ships can be obtained. But if your friends
want to be reasonable and pay the money on delivery we would not quibble about ten
shillings.

We see you were obliged to pay £152 concerning the verdict in the water-balliage case,
and you say you would be glad to know if you should spend something more to prevent the
case coming to a halt. If you believe it would help and see that something can be gained
thereby we shall be glad to spend something more, but we could not agree to making our
expenses still bigger and then lose the whole sum. For the rest we leave it to you to do as you
judge best and as you find matters stand.

Concerning the case of Mr Peter Simons, we can truly say that nothing would please us
more than to assist you but there is not a penny to be got from him here, and we swear on our
conscience that we are owed three times as much as you are, of which we see no chance of
getting a stuiver. He has given us his guarantee, but that is not money, and we do not see how that can help us, or you, in this business. We must break off here and commend you to God’s
protection, &c.",,A. LETTERS TO CHARLES MARESCOE,DUTCH,1669,25 SEPTEMBER 1669,26 Oct. 1669,29 Oct. 1669,,650,,

simultancously both your letters of the 10th and 17th past, to which the answer follows
forthwith.

Concerning the £200 advance on bottomry for the Calmar ship, I understood that this
had been drawn on and that Mr Pels had disbursed the money while you have not paid out
the £200 to Messrs Burkin & Evertsen, so please hold it back until the next post. I shall firstly
correspond with Mr Anthony Bruyn the elder about it and then give you further advice.

The kettle-designs’ have reached Gotland, from whence I am now awaiting them. I hope
at last you will get it right for once.

As for your friend who is asking for a consignment of copper, I cannot accommodate him
this autumn as I have already told you, and since he is in such a hurry for a delivery I must
allow him to be supplied by others. I cannot yet be sure whether I can send anything to
[England] this year, but as for next year—God willing—if you agree with my previous
proposal, to supply me with money this winter at 6 per cent interest, you could count on
receiving a substantial quantity in the spring and I would be able to make a big saving by
keeping these large works with all their people in full employment all through the winter-—
to which I await your decision.

I again commend to you the sale of my goods, especially the thick copper rods. Please sell
them for the best you can get—they are good for making small bars from and are quite as
good as garcopper.
I have now examined your current account and credited you with £2.316 16s uponanew
account dated 6 August—that is to say, for two thousand three hundred and sixteen pounds
sterling and 16s.

While brass-ware is now coming solely into your hands I hope you will drive the price up
rather higher than it has been so far, particularly as garcopper is steadily getting more expensive. Wherewith, my regards, &c.",,A. LETTERS TO CHARLES MARESCOE,DUTCH,1669,8 OCTOBER 1669,26 Oct. 1669,29 Oct. 1669,,357,,

In reply, we have sold the remaining small lead received with the St Justina at D.50 with
3 months time to Vincenzo Fieri. Accompanying this is the account of the proceeds, your
one-third share amounting to D.906 5g bank-money. Please credit us, without prejudice, as
if the money had come in, and if you check over the account and find it correct please make a
note of your concurrence. We are doing everything possible to dispose of the remaining 250
pieces of small lead from the Thomas and Francis, and although there are no buyers now at
D.49 with 3 months credit we shall let no good opportunity pass.

As you will see at the foot of this letter} we have also sold the remaining 6 bales of pepper
from the same ship, together with 21 from the Pearl which, God be praised! arrived here this
week with the Frederick. They took in a passenger at Zante who had been taken there from
Candia, and as result they have been unable to obtain practica.’ All the cargo has been sent to
the Lazaretto and the pepper as well must be re-packed in other sacks. This will cause further
expense, but as there is no other remedy we must be patient. If good purchasers make offers
for the remaining 4 sacks we shall take good care of it. We have been made offers for the first
to arrive, which we believe will fetch a reasonable price. We understand it ought to be selling
in [England] somewhat cheaper but we fear the quantity will pull the price down and we
hope that that which your brother{-in-law] John LeTheullier and his friends intend to send
will be the first to come to market.

The best Stockholm tar in thin casks was lately sold here at D.42 per 1.000 lb. with 30 per
cent tare for the casks. There is not so much demand from buyers for it in thick casks and it
sells at D.4 per 1.000 lb. less with 33 per cent tare—all gross weight. Any ship which comes
fully laden with these goods, among others, enjoys freedom from the new impost on currants
loaded at Zante.

Some salted Irish salmon came with the Pearl for which no price has been established but
we imagine it will fetch about D.28 to D.30 per barrel. Barbados sugar is at D.6 per hundred-
weight with 12 months discount. Spanish muscovadoes are at D.8 with 6 months discount.
Gallipoly oil is D.15§ free on board, and Zante currants have been bought at about R. pta. 29.

Be assured that anything further you may be pleased to order will be dealt with as if your,
and your friends’, interests were as close to our hearts as our own. We remit you herewith
another D.1.200 as indicated at the foot of this letter.§ Please do the necessary and credit us
accordingly. Herewith goes the second copy of the bill of exchange for D.100 remitted you
by our previous letter.

We have sold the 100 pieces of lead from the Pearl at D.s0 with 4 months discount to Bortolo
Massalini and it is now being unloaded and delivered to the buyer. This saves the expense of
bringing it in. At the moment we see no prospect of improvement to judge by the demand of

20th past, in answer to which I see that you have not been able to fulfil my order for sugar
within my limits because of a price-rise occasioned by the hurricane in Barbados, which
undoubtedly caused much damage, so there is no hope of expecting any this year, particularly
as I revoked my order in my last letter. I perceive it has made great changes in [London] but it
is given little credence here and there is absolutely no change, with reasonable goods still
selling at 6; to 6g @ 13 months discount. I do not believe it will cause any price rise for the
moment as there are good stocks here and our sugar bakers are well provided so that there
will be no lack of it for six months. Consequently there will be no commissions sent to
[England] for a while and the price of sugar in [London] may well fall, particularly as it is
believed that the damage in Barbados was not very great. In addition, it is believed that
satisfactory amounts will be obtainable in the spring and, besides that, the present freight-
rates and the dangers of the sea give one good reason for leaving it alone now.

Jan Heere coming from England is—God help us—stranded down the Elbe, although the
dry goods have been mostly salvaged. Thank God I have nothing in her.

Thank you for news of changes—please continue to let me know what is happening

its sale, please do your best, and if not much is to be got for it I shall have to be satisfied for it
was sold for cash. May our dear Lord grant us only good news of it!

As for what you say concerning Mr Maricie(1) having told you that he is in negotiation with
me about cloth—I can tell you that I have not been much away from home for seven years,
but my father-in-law has frequently contracted with him for large quantities and I have often
sent the same people large amounts of iron from Sweden. We have been dealing with one
another for 24 years, but we do not do so anymore and find it is best to take only ready cash.
And when one has had no money to buy goods of which one has had need this man has
treated us very well but since he has been in the cloth court(2) our trade with one another has
come to an end. Since then we have yearly bought large amounts of crown rashes and other
sorts of English manufactures. Now we have our goods brought from [England] and every
year we make two voyages—one early in spring and the other just before winter. So, please
inform me if you have any knowledge of cloth and other manufactures and whether or not
you are involved in the Court and whether you can supply me at first hand in return for a
yearly commission? If so, we can under God do big business with one another and in return
you will be promptly sent other goods such as that in the accompanying bill of lading for a
case of linen of the kind which I have sold great amounts of every year to Mr Moricie’s factor
here. If you can dispose of it a large amount could be sent, and in the accompanying invoice
we have stated the price which Mr Moricie’s factor always paid us so you can see whether it is
reasonable to continue with selling the same.

Please also advise us if steel bars are a good commodity and at what price per ton or per pound they are selling. May God bring the case of linen in safety, with our regards, &c.

of the 10th and 17th past. We looked over the sale account and reported our findings to you
in our foregoing letter. We have now received the current account and will have it examined
next week before telling you our findings.

We will be mindful of sending the requested 10 lasts of pitch and 70 of tar to Yarmouth as
well as the 15 lasts of pitch and 40 of tar to the Isle of Wight if only we can find suitable
shipping. We shall use our utmost endeavours. The 4 ships mentioned in our last letter are
now all lying together being loaded and by our next we hope to send you all their bills of
lading. We are at the moment in negotiation with another to go to [England]: with what
success we will tell you later.

The Lord God be praised for the arrival of Matthys Boriesen and Erick Anderson—may
He bring the others in safety! It is good that you have been able to sell all the cargoes of the
above mentioned and we hope the rest will be similarly disposed of.

Concerning the proposition of your two friends about buying 600 lasts of tar and 200 lasts
of pitch, we refer you to our previous letter and would prefer to look for the highest possible
price, though if your friends would move little further and go up to £9 and £12 we would
agree to it. The offer of £83 and £114 is too little. [We are doing our best to bring it to the
highest price.](1)

Concerning the case of the water balliage on which you seck our approval for spending
more. We urge you to do as you would for yourself, and if you see something to be gained by
it we shall gladly spend more, but if it is a matter of spending yet more on an uncertainty and
then losing the case we would rather lose now than later, so we suggest that you do as you
would for yourself. The directors of the Vastervik Ship Company have probably forgotten
to advise you about placing £177 15s 2d expenses on their account, but they entered in to it
voluntarily and in fairness they must do so because it is their case as much as ours. We shall
speak to them about it so that you can get instructions from them.

By our previous letter we asked you about giving Mr Deutz another £2.000 stg. on top of
the first £2.000 because we would be sending you as much or more in goods, and now you
say you have written to Mr Deutz that he could draw £200-£300—by which you doubtless
mean ‘thousands’. If that is the case, and if you will remit to hin as we requested, we most
cordially thank you. He will not have done so yet, but we are very pleased that you have
written to him and that you will duly honour his bills when he draws on you, though most of
the drafts we have made on him fall due in January and February. We hope you have taken
care of the insurance on all those ships as we ordered.

As we have said to you before, though with much regret, there is nothing here to be hoped
for from Peter Simons. It is very annoying that one must suffer loss for one’s good will, but what can one do? We too think it is hard. We remain, &c.",,A. LETTERS TO CHARLES MARESCOE,DUTCH,1669,9 OCTOBER 1669,29 Nov. 1669,3 Dec. 1669,,601,,

proceeds amounts to D.528 16g bank-money. Please credit us accordingly, without
prejudice, while the money comes in, and after you have checked the account and found it
correct please record your agreement. That commodity remains here still at D.48 because
there is plenty in town and the buyers are for the moment well-provided since—God be

the price remains stable in England and apparently little more will be sent we hope it may
improve in price, particularly in the spring.

we regret that the 9 casks which we received earlier must be kept in the warehouse as the
quantity does not suit the buyers. We hope the batch in the casks will do better and find a

quickly and at the highest price possible and making speedy returns to your friends. We hope
to hear by your next that the ship has departed. May the Lord protect him from mishap and
give him a speedy arrival so that the pepper gets here before the candle-days.(1) Otherwise, the
season will be over. Many say that whoever arrives here before the others can expect to
profit, for undoubtedly the first to arrive will get the best prices.

We understand that The Brothers has also been consigned here with a large amount, and
was lying in the Downs on the point of departure, but as he must go and load the rest of his
cargo with furs we hope the Providence will get here before him. We see that your friends then
plan to procure returns in oil. The latter is selling at D.154 per salm, free on board, at
Gallipoly where it is better value than elsewhere in Apuglia and where most of it is loaded for
[England] and other regions. At Bari it is fetching D.15} free on board, the measure there
being about 6 per cent larger than at Gallipoly but the oil is of worse quality. One can get
reasonably good oil at Taranto but we understand there are no good barrels to be obtained
there and the price of the oil is about the same as at Gallipoly, so in our opinion it would be
best to be provided there. The new oil should be clear by the end of January. It was ordered
here that a quarter of last year’s oil should not be put on sale and the remainder kept at a high
price, but nevertheless it is the opinion of our friends that it may initially fall rather lower as
long as no large commissions are obtained. I believe the said ships will be able to lade the new
oil and think it might not be inadvisable to lade 20 lasts of heavy oil as ballast, as was tried last
with the Gratia, The oil was well-stowed and arrived with little leakage, and since the last of
oil is small we should be able to count on loading at least 700 salm or more, at 10 salms per last,
as it is a ship of 160 tons. You and your friends can best decide what you judge to be advisable
and order us to act accordingly.

There have been no further letters from Zante. The general opinion is that currants there
will cost more than R. pra. 32; on Cephalonia they are paying R. pta. 26 and 27. The John &
Thomas is also going there to fetch its lading and will need a pretty large amount.

Barbados muscovado sugar—D.6 with 12 months time; ditto from Lisbon—D.6 with
6 months. Pepper, since there is little or none left in town, sells at the second hand for D.84.
Veronese rice D.18, with freight for Amsterdam f.65 per last. No change in other
commodities.

We remit you herewith D400 as detailed at the foot of this letter, for which please procure the needful and credit us accordingly. Wherewith our cordial regards, &c.

15th and 22nd October together, to which the answer now follows.

I have seen how much of my goods you have sold and that you think you could dispose of
the rest quite shortly and are therefore expecting what further I should have despatched to
you, especially in the ship you are awaiting from here—but you will have learned from my
last letter that I have heard nothing more of that ship, in which I would otherwise have sent a
consignment, and since no other opportunity of shipping has turned up you must wait until
the spring. Meanwhile you would not do badly to sell all my remaining goods in your hands
at the highest possible price so that we can close the account, and in the spring —God
willing—I can supply you with new goods. As for having more small rods made I shall take
note of what you wrote.

I have credited you with 7s too little which you entered by mistake for the freight you paid
to Jacob Grys. You will have learned already that I have assigned on you the £200 stg., which
you should have paid to Messrs Burckin & Evertsen, to pay to the order of Mr Anthony
Bruyn the elder, who will have sent the assignment to Mr Philip Pelt Emanuel —which I beg
you to fulfil. As for the £296 stg. which you remitted to the Messrs Van Baerle for my
account on the 8th of October, I have already credited you with it on the advice of the Van
Baerles—as I informed you in my last letter.

I have seen your reply about advancing money to help keep my copper-works going and I
am grateful to you for being willing to pay the value of any goods of mine you have in my
hands.

Mr Marescoe, I cannot neglect to advise you that I have been approached by others from
whom you have goods on commission that I should agree to join them in placing our
[English] commissions in other hands. The reason is that you do not manage the expenses
very well and tend to make them rather too large. How much truth there is in that you can
best judge for yourself but I can only give you this friendly advice to serve as far as possible as
a warning of what to expect, for without it you could easily lose their commissions, especially
the principal commission for copper-ware and rods as well as of iron. I have delayed any such change, and but for that it would have happened. Wherewith, regards, &c.",,A. LETTERS TO CHARLES MARESCOE,DUTCH,1669,19 NOVEMBER 1669,4 Dec. 1669,17 Dec. 1669,,456,,

cannot be met, I find myself obliged to reveal to you that it has not been done out of ill-will
or design but simply because I have gone out of business.(1) All last year I suffered great losses
here, as a result of which I have not only lost my capital but have fallen into debt. I had hoped
with time and God’s blessing to recover myself and have done all that was possible but, as
credit has been very scarce in these troubled times and has finally deserted me, it has been
necessary to acquaint my creditors with my lack of means and as a demonstration of my
honesty I have decided neither to run away nor to trouble people further but have proffered
my books with all their debts to reveal my whole condition and to contribute all that still
remains to me in the world to re-payment. Each and everyone feels compassion for me since
they see what misfortunes have overtaken me. I hope that no further injuries will be inflicted
upon me, and I herewith beg you with much boldness to be pleased to give such orders about
your claim that the business may be settled all the easier. Its furtherance in such circumstances
is to your advantage and that of all the creditors, while holding up the business will inflict
great prejudice on all the interested parties. If the Lord is pleased to bless me again I shall
discharge myself to you and all the others so that everyone will be able to see my good
character clearly. This business has not been contrived to distress anyone or to benefit me by
one stuiver, but great losses have forced me to beg for compassion from each and everyone. I
shall also call upon the Lord my God, that he may richly recompense the interested parties for
their loss, and will also do my best to deserve it so that I can satisfy my friends to the best of
my ability, seeking from God his his grace and blessing, to whose protection I commend you,

19th November with the sale account of the iron sent with the St Anna. We have looked it
over, found it correct and noted our agreement with you.

We see you have paid £100 sterling to Capt. Jacob Gries for which he has signed a
bottomry bill and you request our approval—to which we answer that the bottomry bill is
valueless as our colleagues will not approve it. He shall repay the £100 here and it will then be
remitted to you. The captain did it without instructions and had no reason to imagine that he
needed the money as our colleagues had taken care that he could get credit at Lisbon if he
found himself short for his salt cargo.

We see you have sold 238 bars of iron from Gothenburg at 135 6d p. cwt. That is good and
we urge you to keep our interests at heart with the remainder as the consignments sold this
summer have turned to poor account.

The Messrs Louis de la Bistrate & Jacob Frederick Dufay at Amsterdam advise us that they
have drawn £330 sterling on you, not doubting that you will have honoured these drafts as
you have previous orders and noted them on our account.

Trade has finished here for the year and the sea and all rivers can only be traversed with
horse and sledge, and there is a great shortage of water at the works so there will not be much
iron ready for the spring. We suggest therefore that you hold on to our remaining iron, for
the market must rise.

As for the £100 which you gave to the captain of the St Anna on the credit of his salt cargo
we shall, as we said above, make you a remittance as soon as it arrives. The captain had no
need to trouble you. The price at which the iron has been sold in Bristol is disgraceful—it
would have been better to sell it here. As for the samples of materials(1) you sent, they are not in demand here—we can get them cheaper in Holland, wherewith our cordial regards, &c.",,A. LETTERS TO CHARLES MARESCOE,DUTCH,1669,11 DECEMBER 1669,8 Jan. 1670,11 Jan. 1670,,373,,

It put Marescoe’s
liabilities for 635 2/13 lasts of tar and 286 lasts of pitch, despatched but not sold, at £5.463; for quantities already sold,
£1.064 3s. Against this it credited him with £895 3s 1d, but Marescoe's note of sums owing to him for pitch and
tar sold to 14 clients by 20 January 1670 puts the total outstanding at £6,952 17s 10d.","Our last letter was about a week ago, to which we refer, and since then we have received
nothing from you. In our foregoing letter we said of Capt. Jan Pietersen that he had run into
Boswyck in order to repair his ship, but the leak was nothing serious and was soon mended
and he has since gone to sea again, so we hope to hear of his arrival soon. Meanwhile, a week
ago, we made a note of the insurance you made upon him and have credited your account
with £22 6s 7d for the premium and expenses. We long to hear that you have also taken care
of the insurance on the ships following, and with regard to that we refer you to our preceding
letter.

Concerning the advance of money on our goods according to contract, we send herein a
detailed account"" specifying how much they amount to. As we have repeatedly told you, we
have to make good that total to Mr Joseph Deutz on whom we have drawn RD 30.000, but
Mr Deutz says that he has not yet had full agreement from you as to the sum which you will
accept, and that you will only accept as much as the goods in your hands amount to. But that
was not the intention of the contract which clearly states, in the words of the 5th article, that
whenever the Company sends the bill of lading for any pitch or tar and gives orders for it to
be insured, then the Company may draw or have drawn on you for each last of tar £5 and for
each last of pitch £8, which you promised to accept and pay. So we again request you to
make good and pay Deutz the sums specified in the above-mentioned statement when he
draws on you, because the time is approaching when our bills on him fall due. We shall let
Deutz know that he can proceed with assurance, for we would lose his respect if we gave any
orders contrary to the terms of our contract. Our credit would plunge steeply and you can be
sure that he would not be so ready to take our bills in future. Therefore we must show him that he can get his reimbursement from you, or anyone else. We await your reply with quiet

To your news, that the pitch and the linen are safe in the warehouse awaiting buyers, that
you have sold some pitch at £12 per last payable in 8 months time, and that you hope to geta
still higher price I say in reply that I heartily wish you had not sold it at such long time, for a
lot of mishaps can occur during 8 months. I beg you asa friend not to sell at such long time if
possible, and I do not doubt that it will suit you to do so seeing that you are content to do
without double commission. Besides, it will breed more business. I long to know what is
happening and I wish with all my heart to hear from you regarding the linen and to know
what we can do with it. If the price yields something I shall send you 1.000 pieces or more
every year, as long as consumption is that large, and I shall not seek any exceptional profit as
long as I can cover my costs, because between here and Nürnberg we are making a loss. My
brother-in-law is on the point of departure for places like Linz where the linen comes from
and where he will obtain another consignment. We wait to hear what you think about
sending another batch as soon as the rivers unfreeze. As regards the wool, it still remains
unsold but we have had offers from an Englishman here who will make a deal for it, half in
cash and half in goods. As wool remains at 15 per lb. I am not sure what to do. If, at your
convenience, you could inform me at what prices silk stockings and all kinds of men’s and
women’s stockings are selling I shall see if I shall have some bought.

Some days ago Joris Schrodering, a member of one of our great houses,(1) went out of
business and two days ago killed himself in depression, causing the failure of George Mattzen
as a result of many great suspicions. He had served many important merchants on
commission, but I am involved only to the extent of t barrel of Nürnberg-ware, a remnant of
eight years’ dealings. Things are very bad here.

You were perhaps corresponding with the Swedish Treasurer, Borgh Oloffson
Cronenberg, in Stockholm? He has been dismissed and so have Generals Wilhelm
Drakenhielm and Starrenflicht. Hinrich Thuen is now the Royal Treasurer and people are
now making great efforts to find ways of serving him.(2)

Since times are so bad here I shall make use of your offer of help and may well draw £125
or £150 on you in my next letter, as long as you will advance the money at 3 per cent per
month until my goods are sold to that amount. I beg you to accept my bills and wish you a
prosperous New Year,

proceeds of £476 19s 3d. According to our agreement with the late Marescoe please remit
the money either to the widow of Liebert Wolters at Hamburg or to Mr Abraham Bex at
Amsterdam, wherever the profit for me seems likely to be the greater.

I have now received Mr Peter Joye’s letter of 9 September, informing me of Mr
Marescoe’s death—may the Lord grant him a blessed resurrection and us also when the time

Lord, against which there is nothing we can do.

I have been delighted to learn of the arrival of Capt. Anders Beursen with my Slb. 238.12
of iron—God be praised! I hope it has come to a good market. There are some voyages to
Guinea fitting out in [England] so I have no doubt that this consignment of voyage iron will

mentioned before, I await my current account so I can record my concurrence.

I am unhappy to see that you have found the iron which I sent with Beursen to be not as
good as I described it to be, and that you suppose it to be the remnants of iron which I was
unable to sell here. To reply, I have never in my life had to pick and choose any iron but have
always sold and delivered each lot as it comes. I have now been dealing in voyage iron for
over $0 years and before I came to Sweden I supplied large amounts in Holland, at 34 bars per
1.000 lb. —Holland-weight and have had it done so here without any complaints. Six weeks
ago the West India Company of Groningen bought 200 slb of voyage iron without any
complaint and they were satisfied with 34 bars per 1.000 |b. as above.

I beg you to do your best to see that the owners of the ship De Vergulden Valck can obtain
their payment as well as the owners of Den Witte Swaen. I urge this upon you most strongly if
you intend to continue in business. You undoubtedly know well the agreement which
existed between me and your late husband—that I should allow him 3 per cent for provision
in return for which he would bear all bad debts and the cost of remittances through the
exchanges, and advance money at 6 per cent. I shall be glad to hear if you are willing to continue on the same terms. With regards, &c.",,B. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & PETER JOYE,ENGLISH,1670,(ii) 18 OCTOBER 1670,,,,307,,

good. I hope to see the account soon.

I have also noted what has been happening with that person concerning the 60 tons to be
delivered at Stockholm, free on board, The proposal will certainly not suit me. I would not
want to deliver it to an English ship for only £12 because the customs liability on each
shippound would amount to about a quarter of that, quite apart from the Sound Toll which
will be at least 150 RD. And as for going to France to fetch salt and bringing it to Stockholm,
that will not do because there is no demand for French salt in Sweden and there would be no
return from the investment, It is better to drop the whole idea until May when the amount of
iron coming in will increase. No ships can leave Sweden before then because I doubt that
there have been more than four days of thaw so far.

If your friend tries to go looking for a cargo for his ship in the manner you describe his ship
would be at least half-pawned(1) before it came home again. I would not advise him to go to
Sweden with an English ship: the difference in duties is too great.

of the 400 bars of iron I would have been able to decide whether or not to send a further
quantity. I shall only decide to do it if I receive the account and can reckon on some profit. I
must say that to sell at 6 months time is too long, and for the money to be discounted without
prejudice to you is really too much of a risk. As soon as the money comes in I shall expect its
remittance.

I have sent you 400 bars of square iron in Jacob Hendrixsen’s ship De Schol. As Liège iron,
one-inch thick, this iron must be sold for at least 15s 6d [p. cwt] or else it cannot be sent. I
hope it will go higher. I am paid here £7 3/4 [flem.] per 100 lb. in cash for the kind I send to
England. Asa sample I have sent with the captain 25 bars of light, flat-iron weighing (in our
weight) 600 lb. It is marked with an ‘S’ and is extraordinarily fine, tough iron as you will be
able to see, and it is the sort of iron from which pistols and muskets are made. Find out what
price per hundred-pounds you can sell it for and if I consider there is some profit to be made I
shall send you a quantity. The square iron is marked “B’ and is of much better material than the flat-iron I have sent. God protect you, &c.

can get £7 55 there is no point in my starting, for it involves much expense and great wastage

think we could make them as well as anyone at our own works if we could reach agreement
with the Master of the Mint about the price, and provided that he would specifically order a

In reply, I confirm what I said in the foregoing, that as regards making farthings at £6 15s
there is nothing to be done, and the contractors cannot know what they are doing. I would
say the same about delivering a quantity of copper-sheets to the East India Company at
£5 13s per cwt., because the sheets will cost quite as much as that by the time they are free on
board ship and I am not including freight, expenses, commission, risk and the interest on
money. Mr Mitford is the contractor and his partner is Mr Sowton who is at present in
Stockholm and whom I know well. They must be wishing they were free of it because if they
hold to their contract they will not escape without loss. Furthermore, they will not be able to
get them made unless by the Cronströms, my brother or me—and none of us will want to do
it without profit since we are all hard-headed businessmen,‘ and for me to be involved with
them I do not consider advisable.

I see that as a result of some quantities of wire coming from Hamburg the price has been
brought down again to £6 3s at 4 to 6 months time. I have had various amounts of wire
bought at Hamburg and sent to [England] and its cost amounts to at least RD 62 to 63 free on
board ship, so you can work out what profit can be made on it. In order to close the account I
want mine sold as well as others. I have ordered 100 shippound at Stockholm to be loaded
into a ship for [England] but the ship has now been entirely freighted by the Cronströms or
Wolters who will not suffer any others to load anything in her. However, some time will
elapse before the ship will be ready and I hope meanwhile some other opportunity will offer, which you will learn of in due course, wherewith my regards, &c.",,B. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & PETER JOYE,DUTCH,1671,1 APRIL 1671,27 Apr. 1671,5 May 1671,,360,,

have received a scaled bag with 500 ducats. While it is very welcome to learn that, we are—
on the contrary—very surprised to hear that the 500 ducats are very light-weight and will
scarcely amount to 9s 24d [each], on top of which the exchange has also fallen by 2d, so that
the outcome differs considerably from our estimate of 9s 5d and 35s 7g [per £1 sterling].
Seeing that there is no prospect of anything but loss (with which we must have patience) it is
better that no more ducats are sent. Please do the best you can with them, and if you should
make no remittance you can set them against the moneys which his Excellency may have
necd of.

We look forward to being informed by your next letter about what has happened in both
these matters, and we further thank you for the news of what is happening in trade. As

purchase of a quantity of indigo, I have been unable to make up my mind since that
commodity is in declining demand, and I also understand that great deceits have been found
inside the sealed boxes which have come from [England] and some batches have been found
to be extremely oily. Sugar also will do no wonders here notwithstanding the fact that there
is little obtainable in [England]. Large amounts are coming from Portugal and just now §
ships, mostly laden with it, have arrived from Oporto. The ships which are expected daily
from Spain will also not fail to provide good quantities of indigo, so I can see no advantage in
bringing these two commodities from [England] unless they should come to very moderate
prices on the arrival of the Caribbean ships. If there should be some change, especially in
sugar, I shall be glad to participate. Ginger has been in some demand here but since substantial
amounts have arrived in [England] and more are expected it should soon fall in price. Cottons
will do no wonders here for the moment, though little may come this year; pepper seems not
yet to be at its lowest level, and galls—as I have said before—will not rise for the present. I
would be glad to know how much semencina’ or semensaet costs in [England] and whether
there is much in stock, and I look forward to more fruitful opportunities arising from our correspondence. I remain, with cordial regards, &c.

advisable to participate in the contract for making farthings. How the contractors will fare,
time will tell. I can also foresee no profit in sending copper-plate or sheet copper, especially
since the duties have been raised. I wish you would send me an exact list of the duties on all
imported Swedish wares for my guidance. As for the rest of my wire, I hope you will soon
dispose of it so that I can close the account. As for the wire I had at Stockholm, since I could
not load it in the ship freighted by Cronström and as no other opportunity arose, I let it go to
Hamburg.

The inland waters are just beginning to thaw and so the goods from up-country can now
begin to come down. I hope we shall soon have the convenience of some shipping. I have
noted that I can draw on you when the bills of lading for goods are sent and orders given for
their insurance. I shall be glad if you would send me some samples of pans and kettles aboard a

that you have sold and delivered the 997 bars of voyage-iron which I sent with Hans
Michelsen. I have received the sale account, examined it, found it correct and debited you
with the net proceeds of £188 8s 3d stg. which you mentioned in your letter, without
prejudice. As you know perfectly well, the 3 per cent which you charge me relates to the sale
of iron and to the remittance of bills of exchange as well, as was agreed with the late Mr
Marescoe. You have undertaken to continue on the same conditions which you have
confirmed in several letters, though I can quite believe that you did so precipitately. You will
have debited the £4 11s 0d for the 20 bars which Anders Beursen delivered short, although
since I have received some information from the Crown galley I expect to be able to make
good some of it.

I have credited you with 30s for the blue waistcoat. I have received 150 slb of iron out of
Varmland, but as it is of only ordinary quality I have not wanted to send it but thought of
using it as ballast in our ships and sending it to Portugal where it can make RD 8 per slb. Pitch
has fallen into diverse hands here and is exported to [England] by various people and then
undersold. I have spoken to several and told them that a friend of mine wanted to lay out
some money, but what can I say, seeing that there are various ‘cladders’ here who also want to
do so. The same thing is beginning to happen with iron. There are some who, for cash down,
are selling at 8 or even 12s lüb. per slb below the ordinary price. It is also falling in price in
Hamburg. If I can get it to Portugal before these others there might be no great loss—time
will tell.

It is a good thing that the new duties in [England] on iron and other wares will not
commence this year. The King here has also been thinking of raising the duty by 16 stuivers
per slb, though so far it has not been done, but some small ships have had their exemption
taken away and must now pay 8 stuivers more per slb, though the King has been petitioned
about it. If any changes should occur we shall learn in due course.

I have obtained acceptance of the £100 remitted to Bex at Rotterdam at 36s 1g and today I
got news from the widow of Libert Wolters that you had remitted her £188 for my account
in two bills at 35s 3g, for which acceptance has been procured. I shall be glad to learn soon
from Mr Bex what remains to be remitted to Amsterdam.

Anders Beursen arrived here over three weeks ago without delivering to me the basket
with 24 bottles of Spanish Canary. Before your letter of the 21st of April came the basket was
delivered to someone else who thought that Jan Kreuger had sent it to him, and the customs
official and some others have enjoyed some of the bottles. Nevertheless you have my thanks,
seeing that there is no other way of demonstrating my gratitude from this country-town.

prospect of a decline than a rise in prices. For the freight from here to London one should be
able to get it at f:12 or 22s sterling per last of 12 barrels. If the Stockholm tar is in oak barrels
one might possibly get served for a little less but not much.

Regarding the information you ask for concerning the goods of Jacob Reenstierna, we can
tell you that the late Mr Marescoe, being asked by us to advance money on the goods which
the said Reenstierna had sent him at our disposal, desired that we would permit him (in case of
bad debts or being otherwise unable to recover his outlay) to re-draw on us, which we agreed
to; but now that the said Reenstierna has asked us if he can reckon upon and dispose of the
value of the goods which have just gone to you in London we seck to be freed from the
liability of such debts, since they only concern Reenstierna, not us, and we could have justly
refused Mr Marescoe’s request because we were only obliged to cover his commission, not his
debts. And although you say that no bad debts need be expected to arise from the sale of these
goods, we trust that the debt duc from the widow Birckhead(1) will be collected and that you
will confirm that we run no risk concerning any debt arising from the said Reenstierna’s
goods and that we need expect no retrospective demands or re-drafts. In that case we can
allow the remaining advance to be credited to Reenstierna and paid according to his order.

Mr Willem Momma wrote to us some time ago, that he was disinclined to send goods to
London because of the poor prices and the length of time it took to recover debts; and Lord
Reenstierna no longer sends any goods at our disposal to other places, in order (we believe) to
save the commission-charges. And because of the hostility between this country and France
he is sending much of his output to Hamburg where there is better business than here.

We understand that the Lord Cronström was here for only a few days before returning;
Mr Louis Wolters is still here but is returning to Hamburg shortly, and it is believed that Mr
Libert Wolters will then be coming back here. These are people with big ideas and many worries.(2) We remain, &c.","London: 35s 11-10 1/2g @ 2 usances.

I see that the ‘O’ iron would fetch a reasonable price but it is now too late in the year to
have it made, and there is none that has been made because iron has been in too much demand
and little was made in previous years.

The latest letters tell me that a schuyt with about 600 slb of ‘O’ and ‘G’ iron was under way
to Stockholm on which there was also a quantity of pan iron and that it would be quickly
unloaded. It will then be loaded all together in the Graf Wrangels Palais as agreement has been
reached with the skipper about the freight. I estimate that about 1.000 slb will be shipped in
him, of which the bill of lading will be sent to you in due course. I have no doubt that iron
will hold its price with you, as it does here, and sell just as easily as it has been, ordinary iron
being sold at f.7 1/4 and f.7 3/8 and ‘O’ and ‘G’ at f.8 1/2 to f.8 3/4. They have had so much rain in

July, 4th and 22nd of August and 1st instant, which for lack of occasion I have not answered
earlier. Thanks to your letters I fully understand what has been happening to trade [in
London]. Business here is poor in general and as a result I have not had the courage to order
anything and I am all the more reluctant because goods are so cheap that a good deal of
cheating is going on by mixing bad stuff with the good. I have had proof of that by several
consignments from you, the latest being with the campeachy wood which was not packed as
it should have been. Every day I have to hear much complaint about it and there are many
people in this city who will certainly never buy any more from me. It lacks any colour, as if it
had been ground and boiled out completely, just as one finds it when it has been baked in
some great fire. In short, you have badly encumbered me, which makes me reluctant to order
anything more. Today the East India Company are selling their goods in [London]. There is
nothing to be done with pepper as it is so abundant that it is being undersold and will only
yield a loss. Barbados sugar is definitely not required now that muscovadoes are so cheap that
one can buy them for 8g in current money with 13 months to pay. One can get reasonably
good [Barbados sugar] for 5 1/2g at 13 months in current money which differs by 4 3/4 per cent
from bank-money. I see that it is now down to 20s in [London] and that is for good quality.
Inshort, I have no relish for any just now. However, I shall meanwhile expect a note now and
again saying what is happening to that and other commodities. Oil has risen again here, but
because I have been badly served by you on two occasions I am afraid to acquire any. It has
soared from RD 52 to 62. Black ginger is at 12g with 13 months time; galls 41 to 42 ML at
13 months. The price-list states that there is a two-fold price for campeachy wood: please
explain what that means. I have made a note of the way in which your bills of exchange will
be signed. May God grant that something will turn up which will produce some profit, so that we can have something satisfactory to exchange bills about! Meanwhile may you remain

12th instant, by which I see that instead of 34 sacks of white ginger you have only loaded 24 in

Hendrick Roys’ ship. The invoice has been received and noted, but I have further observed

that you have only bought 6 sacks of white at 70s, the rest being of another kind, at which

I am extremely astonished and upset because I emphatically ordered you long ago to buy

5.000 lb. at the lowest possible price and to lay out any credit balance on my account on white

ginger, and only if none was to be had to get black ginger. You repeated my orders in your
letters of the 18th and 25th of August, the rst, 8th and 12th of September. In your letter of
August 25th you wrote that the best price at which you could get 4.000 to 5.000 lb. of white

was 68s; in the letter of September 1st you were still doing your best; in the letter of
September 8th you wrote that, on the day before, white ginger was fetching 7os 6d on the
Exchange, and in your letter of the 12th you say that there are not 100 sacks left in the whole
city and that the last batch went for 72s 6d. Notwithstanding the fact that I gave you a free
hand, and although the price in [London] has been 68s, 71s 6d and 72s 6d according to what
you write, you failed to buy me any. I certainly never restricted you to any price so you
ought to have been able to get hold of it as you promised. I have every reason to complain
about you in this way. What is the point of writing to me with every letter that you had made
a note about buying for me at the current price and in the meantime doing nothing about it?
You can judge for yourself whether you have done well for me or badly. If you had complied
with my order and bought white ginger it would have turned out very well because this sort
of ginger is very scarce here and dear, so I am extremely vexed that you wasted this excellent
opportunity and instead of white bought me black. However, I suppose I must have patience
and credit you with the 20 sacks of brown ginger at 47s, 5 butts and 6 puncheons at 48s, and
about 110 sacks at sos. I have made a note of them and trust that this batch will turn out to be
exceptionally fine since you have paid such an exceptionally high price for it. Brown ginger is
at a standstill here; there is plenty in stock and no demand. I shall expect an invoice and a bill
of lading as soon as all my ginger is shipped, and I hope you have divided it between two ships. As for indigo and campeachy wood, you had better leave them alone. I must break off
in haste, and cordially commend you to God’s protection, &c.

lying ready to depart, only it lacks a good cargo and nothing has appeared so far except
40 tons of currants to be shipped to England from Zante, but as that is too little we have not
undertaken it. We see little prospect of getting any freight at present as the St George is short
of halfits cargo and is looking for freight, and that is a capital ship in which one would rather
load than in the Providence if there was anything. We expect a friend’s letter shortly from
Zante about another 20 to 30 tons of currants to be laden in the same way as the
abovementioned 40 tons. If we could have them both together we would not wait for
anything more in order to get the ship on its way, because we firmly believe that our friend
would want more that R. pta. 20 per ton if the ship were to lie here a long time, costing
money, just in order to supplement its cargo. We would send the cash and the barrels to
Zante and urge our friend to obtain the best goods at the least possible price. We hope this
will turn out to the satisfaction of your friends and that good business can be done with the
currants, which have turned out to be very fine and dry this year. The price has not yet been
settled. The proceeds of your goods, which will be coming in shortly, will serve for payment of your share of the currants. We will let you know what happens, and remain meanwhile,

As regards what is happening to copper-wire and other brass ware, there can be no fall in

Herewith is a bill of lading for 4 barrels of pots and 2 barrels of black kettles, loaded for my
account at Stockholm in the ship St Anna, captain Jacob Grys, and although it is stated there
to be only Slb. 18.15 in weight it correctly weighs as follows:

Please get them insured for £300. The pots have been accurately made according to your
design and ought to sell for £7, although I am not binding you to a price. They are 14 to 15
inches large, or less. That two barrels are marked ‘M’ and two marked “H’ is because they
contain pots made by two different master-craftsmen, so they can be distinguished, but I trust
they are both equally good.

This week there will be despatched to Norrköping for loading in the ship Graeflyck Huys

from the largest to the smallest, made according to your design, and if I hear that they are in
demand I shall work on them diligently throughout the winter so that, God willing, I can
provide you with a lot more in the spring.

It may well be that Messrs Luce & Van Bommel] are expecting a large amount of copper-
wire, and I think it will be in Gerrit Laurens’s ship. I understand that my brother is offended
that you allowed his bills of exchange to be protested. What reason you had for doing that I
do not know. The English are buying up iron in Stockholm at 31 d.c.m. per slb so that I
perceive more profit in selling it here than by risking it across the seas.

I shall be glad to know if latten is selling [in London] and I trust that the business of the
farthings is not going ahead. If it does it will be to the great loss of the contractors. The

for value received, which we hereby confirm. Having heard nothing from you this letter will
be brief and serves mainly to accompany the second copy of the bill for £250, in case you
have lost the first. We hope you will have got it accepted and promptly paid when due—but
if not, you will know how to get it protested in [London]. Enclosed herewith goes a letter to
the said Momma which you will please have passed on to him and procure an answer. Our
friends, Paulus and David van Stetten of Augsburg, correspond with this Momma and
remitted him some money towards the purchase of some goods (which we think were furs)
and for some posts they have had no letter from him. In his last letter he wrote that he was
going into the country because he was unwell but that as soon as he was better, the following
week, he would be coming back to town. So they are afraid that he may have died or that his
business is in a bad way, and have asked us to write to our correspondents about it to inform
them about his condition and to draw on him £250 sterling as he still owes them £300 stg.—
all which we have done in our previous letter, sending you the bill of exchange and enjoining
you to do what was necessary. The Messrs Van Stetten, who are such great friends of ours
that we cannot refuse them, now further request us to warn our friends in [England] in case
this Abraham Momma, with his business in a bad way, does not accept the bill of exchange
though the goods which they ordered have not been sent. In that event, they have sent us the
enclosed power of attorney written in Latin, wherein they give us complete authority to act
on their behalf and settle matters with him, together with a clause allowing us to substitute
whoever we want where they have left our name blank, in case it should be necessary. So we
have substituted your name, to demand an account from the estate of the said Momma on
behalf of the Messrs Van Stetten. You must forgive us for taking this liberty but since we
have no other correspondents in [London] we could not call upon anyone else. We shall be
greatly obliged to you and will wait for you to send your expenses and other charges
regarding this business. It may be that the man is perfectly well and there is nothing to worry
about, in which case it will not be necessary to the use the power of attorney, but please hold
it in [London] until further order. Meanwhile, keep us informed how matters stand,
forgiving us for the trouble. Keep a separate note of the postage of these letters so that we can
recover it from our friends.

As regards trade, we know of little to say. If war should break out between France and the
Dutch we believe there will be changes in the prices of many goods. Ginger is at a standstill.
We have checked the account of the 41 sacks of black ginger, found it correct and recorded
our agreement. We now await the bill of lading. The wind continues steadily east so no ships
can come and Jacob Giese will also be driven back should God allow him to continue his
journey. This commodity is too high in price, one should keep one’s hands clear of it. As we
said in our last letter, we want no more ginger or indigo. The price of sugar has increased a
little and if you can obtain a good batch you may spend 22 to 22 1/2s. We shall now wait to hear
what you advise. Fine Barbados cotton is no use to us at more than 4 1/2d. We shall be glad to

I also informed you that I have got into a dispute with Capt. Jacob Gries over the freight of
the 11 barrels(1) of ginger, which I now confirm. He claims that there are 4 butts to a last and
that 6 puncheons were also reckoned to equal one last, just as sugar butts and puncheons
always are. But I understand that one last is reckoned to weigh 4.000 Lb.,(2) while a butt of
ginger only weighs 600 to 700 lb. and a puncheon about 400 lb. As against that a butt of sugar
amounts to at least 1.100 or even 1.500 lb. and a puncheon of sugar between 700 and 1.000 |b.
But he insists that he had expressly stipulated and agreed with you and that you had
accordingly instructed him that he might take them on such conditions. Whatever the truth
is, please inform me in answer to this, for he will not concede one stuiver, which I consider
unreasonable since in this way I shall have to pay nearly 3 or 4 times as much freight as I
should. In future, I beg you not to send any more ginger in casks. Here we are always
accustomed to have it in sacks, for which we must buy linen and have it sewn, which causes

great inconvenience and expense.
There is no consumption of ginger here. I shall be most grateful if you will tell me what is
happening in [England] with regard to silk, and beg you to find out as much as you can and as
carefully as you dare what quantities are coming to Smyrna of Ardasse and Legee [silks] and
also what the prices are likely to be. Please do not bother to send a price-current unless there are from time to time some alterations—the letter-post is too expensive. Wherewith my

will sell as they ought. Copper has risen to RD.76 at Hamburg, and brass ought to fetch
proportionately. It is true, as you say, that while goods are coming in such abundance the
retailers ought not to see the extent to which they come. Even more, this ought to be kept in
mind by the wholesalers who ought not to sell for less than it costs to make. Otherwise it
would be better for the works to close down, just as those at Lübeck and Hamburg must now
do, for while they get only 6 to 8 rixdollars per slb more than the present price of brass they
cannot keep on going. So it is only you who can alter things, and I repeat what I have said
before—I would rather that you leave goods unsold for 6 months than sell them for 6 months

I have no doubt that you will do your best for me. As for the farthings, I have said before
that it is a most damaging contract for the Cronströms, as well as for all others who have
contracted to deliver copper or plates. I would not have sent the last lot of latten unless it had
been convenient to send with the other goods, and as the amount is not large it will be easily
used up by the copper-smiths.

5.000 lb. of good, white scraped ginger at the best price possible but that the black ginger had
better be left alone since the price was running so high, and that if you bought Barbados
indigo it must be absolutely choice and saleable stuff.
In this letter we only want to say that there have been no letters from London today so we
do not know if any changes are occurring in commodities. We want to know in your next
letter what you have been able to do for us regarding the white, scraped ginger. As for the
black, we shall think about it for a while since the price is too high and the sale of it begins to
diminish, so the price will fall again as it is already beginning to do. With regard to galls,
everything is very quiet; as for cotton and Ardasse, there is no demand. Of indigo we hope
you have bought us nothing since you must have also heard in [England] of the arrival of the
flota in Spain, very richly laden with great quantities of indigo and campeachy wood. For
people well know that when great amounts of some merchandize arrive the price always falls.
Doubtless you have considered that, and we shall be glad to hear that before you saw this
letter you had not bought us any. Please leave it alone since there is no profit to be got from it.

We find that the most recent letters mention Barbados sugars as being at 21 1/2 to 21s, by
which they think they must be at their lowest; but we doubt that, because there is so little
consumption of refined sugar and unrefined is in such poor demand that there is a rebate of
8 2/3 per cent on 5 1/4g in current or common money (which differs by 4 1/2 per cent from bank
money) which is a miserable price. We do not think it has ever been as low as 5 1/2g banco
before, except for a short while before leaping strongly upwards. And we recall that it was
once at 20s and 19 1/2s in [London] and the exchange was more favourable than it is now, so it
may well fall back to 20s or below, which would not be strange in view of the high rate of
exchange and poor sales through lack of consumption. Seeing in the latest letters that 5 or 6
ships from Barbados were unloading, take the risk of finding for us a nice little consignment
of really choice stuff, which must not be dirty, and if you can get it for 21s 6d at the highest,
free on board, you may buy us ro butts and send it here under our usual mark. Once before
we had a batch which was in small barrels of about 300 lb. per barrel, which was very white
and completely dry: we would be glad to have similar, or even better, goods. Ordinary
coarse stuff is no use to us, even for 20s or below; we have fixed the price rather high in order
to have good quality. You may watch out for us to see if you can obtain such a fine
consignment of 10.000 to 11.000 lb. but if it is not obtainable, let it go.

We remit with this, for our account, £200 stg. at 2 usances and [blank] days in a bill of
Samuel Free payable by Mr William Robinson. Please procure the necessary and let it serve towards the purchase of our goods. Wherewith we send you our most cordial regards, &c.","London: 34s 6g.

iron by 2 or 3 dollars to 31 d.c.m., but I think that when they get news from here about the
war the price of iron will return to its old level. Iron prices are weak here since none can be
exported and Sweden must follow suit unless all the English come and buy a lot and thus
inflate the price. Other commodities, on the contrary, have risen very considerably. Let me

The ship Coning David will probably be the first to leave Stockholm for [England]. I
expect to get further news about it in the next letters from Sweden as in the last they said the
waters were still not open. You will be receiving a good quantity of iron when she comes.

Sweden will be remaining neutral this summer. If a ship can be found going to Stockholm,
and if time does not allow you to wait for my further orders, please procure just 20 pipes of
the best Barbados sugar you can buy and ship it off for the account of the Directors of the
[Swedish] Sugar Refining Company, sending me the bill of lading and the account and
drawing on me at double usance. Only please make sure it is the best.

Please let me know what one has to give for insurance in London from there to
Stockholm.

Copper-wire is selling here for f.63, garcopper at f.67 to f.68; Gothenburg iron for f.7,
Stockholm iron for f.7 1/2 to 7 3/4, Orgronds f-9 to f-9 1/2, since the ‘O’, ‘G’ and ‘L’ marks, as well as

Since the war has been proclaimed many commodities have risen in price here, especially

The sea will now be very unsafe and scarcely to be used. We now pay a 10 per cent premium
to send goods here from [England] on free ships, and if we once get news that any ships have
been seized by the Dutch or other capers I certainly believe we shall not find insurers at any

quite a good price but not what it ought to fetch in future in view of the price of copper
here, on which the duty has been raised to 42} d.s.m. money per slb. On brass it has been
raised from 93 to 15 d.s.m. per slb and so in future these goods ought to cost more in

So far I have not been able to arrange any shipping at Stockholm for [London] because the
inland waters are still frozen and we have also learned that there is open war between England

others which were joined with it, We are assured here that our ships will be allowed to sail
unmolested by the French and English and we hope that they will not be refused by the
Dutch.

I am sorry to see that you have had a misunderstanding with my brother Jacob. I do not
know what to say, but if only you had written to him in good time about what debts were
still outstanding and which were doubtful. At the close of every account one ought to specify
whether debts are still outstanding or not, and I beg you not to omit this when you send me
my account as I also think one ought to be quite precise. Meanwhile, thank you for the offer
you have made to my sons, to accept up to £300 if they should draw on you: I think you have
about that much in hand on my account. They write to me that they do not have any need of
it for the present, but in future please accept their bills up to the value of £400—£500 on my
account, for with this war-time situation it could well happen that, through one change or
another, they may stand in need of it.

In reply, your brother John
Lethieullier has revoked the purchase of pepper for his account and we shall do the same for
yours. Indeed, it really must be done because that commodity is daily held at D.100 to D.103
without any prospect of abatement. These wars endanger shipping to such an extent that
nothing can be brought from [England] or Holland without great risk. If France fails to
obtain the pepper which is known to have just arrived at Lisbon in the ship from the East
Indies it is likely to come to Italy which may well cause some fall in prices since this country is
well-supplied with it and it is only these troubles which stiffen the price. But if the war
continues for long and the only pepper coming to Italy comes out of France the price may rise
higher, which God forbid!

There is no change in the price of lead apart from the last purchases we informed you of.
Since then it has been at D.70 but there are no buyers and there is a large amount in town.
Therefore, on the arrival of the Blackmore (which God grant may arrive soon in safety) we
think it advisable to dispose of your so pieces at the highest possible price. We do not see any
prospect of any great alteration in the immediate future. At Leghorn it fetches D.314, which
is much less than here. We will be glad to hear from you about this, if you think it
worthwhile. Large quantities of lead are being brought from Germany now and are selling at
D.70.

Since you have procured acceptance of the D.235 which we remitted to you we do not
doubt that you will be duly paid. As soon as the rest of what is due on your account is received
we shall remit it immediately. Bortolo Marinoni owes for lead which came from the Coninck
David. We have presssed him diligently and will let you know when we succeed. The
Sommission which came from Lisbon with sugar is loading oil here. Muscovado sugar fetches
D.8 3/4 with 4 months time; powdered sugars D.12 to D.14, according to quality. There is very
little left in town in the wholesalers’ hands since it has been mostly bought up by engrossers.
Barbados sugar, D.6; pepper-powder, D.11 with 10 per cent tare; oil at Gallipoli is D.13 1/3 free on board. In other commodities there is no change and from overseas we have heard nothing

For all these payment has been procured but only through the bank because payment cannot

Mexican reals weighing 65 marks 5 ounces, and one sack of Seville reals weighing 45 marks,

time, we were unable to check them. With our next letter we hope to send the bill of lading
and advise you of the amount. We are informed that no rixdollars or pieces of eight are
obtainable in Rotterdam and we do not think it advisable to send any that way for the time

so now at the persuasion of the Lord Lillienhoff who, according to his enclosed letter,
recommends me to you and assures me that when I transfer all my London business to your
hands you will do me all the good offices possible. Thereupon I have decided to consign to
you my own ship, called De Hoop, which sailed for London from here only a few days ago.
The captain is Simon Leysten, with whom I have loaded a quantity of iron and deals for my
own account, as you can see from the enclosed invoice. At first I had addressed them to Mr
William Strang of London but have now come to a different decision and herewith direct
them to you, requesting you to arrange their reception and to sell them to my greatest
advantage. I have given orders to Mr Strang that, if the ship arrives before the letter and is
unloaded, he should transfer all my goods to you for my account, but if not the captain has
orders to deliver to you. Mr Strang will hand over all the papers regarding this, for there are
some parcels of iron which belong to other friends at London who are to shoulder the freight
charges according to the signed bills of lading, whereofa detailed specification goes herewith.
And as the captain is a bit dimwitted? please give him some help in case he makes a mistake
about the freights, which you will be so kind as to receive and credit to my account, holding
it for my further disposal. Lord Lillienhoff has also assured me that whenever I send you
goods, even up to £2.000-worth, I shall be able to draw up to three-quarters of the value in
return for reasonable interest. I trust that you will allow me to enjoy such accommodation,
about which I await your answer. I shall thereupon send you further ships’ cargoes such as
Iron, pitch and tar, as well as of hemp, so that you will have quite enough goods of mine in
your hands,

If Captain Lysten is already with you Mr William Strang has orders to send him on to

I have since received yours of the 5th by which you have remitted me another £90 at 345 3g

Because the situation in Holland remains so serious people here are not thinking much
about trade or buying goods, of which we already have more than enough. Many, whoare in
need of ready cash, are disposing of their goods for what they can get, so this is no time to
order more, even though commodity prices in [England] have fallen greatly. I shall be glad to
know if yet more sugar is expected from Barbados this year. It is a commodity which is very
cheap here now and virtually unsaleable. Meanwhile I must thank you for news about what is

I am not happy to see that my wire and brass, remaining from last year, is still unsold, and I
hope it will be disposed of before the new lot arrives. Furthermore (as I have mentioned to
you before) please sell my goods as soon as possible after their arrival. I would prefer that you

which they are insuring, if and when they are sold. And as our iron- and wire-works are very
burdensome and we are overloaded with iron and wire which we cannot turn into money in
these difficult times, we request that you give us sympathetic support in these circumstances
and accommodate us as far as you can without prejudicing yourselves—i.e. by allowing us to
draw on you for 8 or 10 months the balance to which our goods amounts to, payable to the
order of Manoel Teixera. He can oblige us, and we have formed a special friendship with
him.

We calculate that the amount of iron, including what is in the ship De Patientia (which,
God permitting, will have arrived before this)
If we could now draw RD 7,000 as we have
before it would be an act of great friendship, and as for the remainder we would reckon it as
the RD 2,500 due from the Lord Leyonbergh. Next week the following will be cleared,
namely: an obligation dated 27 July from Abraham Wolters to pay at 6 months for
RD 397.25; also an assignment on the bank to pay on 29 November 2,400 dollars copper
money, and 3,409 dollars copper money to be paid in cash. The rest will be paid next week
with an obligation from Caspar Robbert though without prejudice to us. Of these, the
obligation from Abraham Wolters has come in and the others from Caspar Robbert and the
bank.

We have seen with nothing but great astonishment what you say about our wire, which is
nevertheless in as great demand here and in Holland, Hamburg and France as any other. We
beg you to take the proceeds, for the difference is quite considerable, and they must be wicked
people who refer to it in this way. We urge you to take care of our interests.

(if it can be had at 40s or below, free on board) as well as 20 sacks of fine Aleppo galls, if they
can be had for sos per cwt. However, as galls are standing at 53 to 54s it is no use thinking that
anything can be done with them. However, some other friends of ours hold out the hope that
brown ginger may well fall to 38s. You will know how to procure them advantageously for
us, and when you have done so divide them between two Hamburger or other free ships and
send them here, giving us due notice by which captain they are sent—but please do not send
them in English ships.

Since indigo seems likely to be at reasonable prices please also buy for us about £130 stg.~
worth of fine Jamaican or Caribbean indigo which looks saleable and of high quality, if you
can get it for 3s 1dor 3s 2d at most, free on board. And please make sure that it is not of small,
dirty pieces to which people strongly object: a weak blue is of no use to us. You can send it to
us here under our customary mark. Pepper still fetches 162g here but vendors are happy to
deliver it for 16g at 6 months time and good quantities are sold. The world is full of pepper
and demand is very small. We shall have to wait and see; we believe it may perhaps be sold
more cheaply by some individuals, or it may stay at the same price—time will tell.

20 to 215 for sugar is certainly not dear although there is nothing to be done with it here.
Nevertheless, if we had room in our own houses we would order some but they are full up
with goods and unless we hire a warehouse, which is very expensive here, we can not have
any. We are also well-supplied with Ardasse and it is cheaper here than in [England].
Meanwhile we shall be glad to learn more about what is happening with one thing or another so that we can act accordingly. Friendly regards, &c.","London: 33s 8g 2 usances.

m-d_213,213,W. MOMMA to LM & PJ,361,W. MOMMA,LM & PJ,"Regards, &c. ",NYKÖPING,NYKÖPING 29 SEPTEMBER 1672,1 John Slaughter.,"My last letter was on the 8th instant. Since then I have received yours of the 13th and 23rd
past from which I see that you have procured insurance on Gerret Laurens’s ship of £400 at
4 1/2 per cent and £950 at 5 per cent. I hope you have since been able to procure the remainder.
I have also received the current account which you closed on the 13th of August by which
there is due to you £5.237 15s 8d. lagree with that, but find that you have brought together
into the outstanding debts due on recent sales old debts amounting to £1.594 16s 2d. New
debts cannot be mixed up with old debts. I also find that Anthony Hatch, Skepper, Slutter(1)
and Sampson delay somewhat. I hope they have paid up since then, and please ensure that no
new debts are put down with the old ones. Also, specify how much each person owes
without lumping together two or three persons unless they are in partnership and the one is
liable for the other. Prices are bad and insurance costly so it does not help to make bad debts.
Please take care therefore, as you have until now. You seem to believe that my goods have
been fully drawn against so I must calculate according to your own account what brass has
been sent to you,

It is true that the iron ought not to be included in the calculation because it is not insured, but
without the same it would not differ by more than £100—£200, if you have accepted the
£800 which has just been drawn on Gerret Laurens. The great decline in prices goes beyond
what I had expected, and I had hoped to have £400—£ 500 more in proceeds in hand. Ido not
doubt that you will accept this £800 as well as what I have drawn against the goods in Erick
Anderson Boy. You can expect no more this year. My view is that your prices are now at
their lowest point and that with winter coming they will begin to fetch more.

I have noted that you sold, in addition to the 250 coils of wire on 2 August to Wathing &
Woodfield, another 350 coils to the same, all at £6 tos with 4 months time; to John Skepper
20 brewing-plates, cwt. 10.1.8 lb, of pots at £6 10s and 12 cwt. of latten at £6 with
6 months time; and to Grice the remaining pots from the Jupiter as well as 23 cwt. of latten at
£6 10s in 6 months, and this account you have put with the outstanding debts due on the old
account.

I have now received by the last post in my sons’ letters news that Capt. Jacob Grys was
intercepted and brought in to Rotterdam by capers, although I hope he will soon be released
as petitioned for, Ifnot, it would be advisable if you sent over the policy on the brass, which is
insured only against the risks of the sea, with a simple attestation that the iron is not insured.
My sons will probably have written to you about it. I hope to have better news about Gerret Laurens and Erick Anderson Boy, God willing. Regards, &c.",,B. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & PETER JOYE,DUTCH,1672,29 SEPTEMBER 1672,19 Oct. 1672,25 Oct. 1672,,545,,"vizt.— remaining of the old Slb 20.02.02

see that the ship Zon[?] had arrived in the river—for which the Lord God be thanked—and I
trust it has now safely reached the city.

Captain Jacob Grys also is now entirely free so he is ready to take his departure for London
at the first opportunity.

It is very good to see that you have sold more iron, but I am not glad to see that the price is
falling so much for it is not at all adequate, and as for what you were offered for the
remainder, the time allowed for payment is also much too long. If one sells a batch in that
way, even if it is a lot, the price is bound to decline. Nevertheless, as I really see no present
prospect of much improvement I am forced to think that one must go along with it. I trust
that with these low prices the said iron will now sell rather better and in the coming year fetch
rather more once it is better known.

Regarding the accounts of these ships: I cannot see that much iron of importance will be
shipped out of Sweden to London. It is not merely because of these low prices, heavy freight-
charges and expenses but also because there are no more ships to lade, all the large ships
having been already despatched. It looks as if the increase in the toll will be set aside. I have
received news from the Sound that Capt. Hendrick Mattson has arrived safely there—for
which the Lord be thanked. Let me know at once for how much you can sell timber and

deals.
A letter from Stockholm dated the 28th tells me that they will know shortly whether the
duty will be reduced or remain the same.

There are still two large ships lying at London! which should soon be ready to depart,
loaded mainly with iron, as I believe. [long to have the account of the iron cargo sold at Hull.

latter, which I received first, I see that you have bought for me 50 sacks of brown Barbados
ginger at 40s, free on board, and that you intend to load it on D[irick] Roys. I am waiting to
hear that you have succeeded and to receive the bill of lading and invoice. I hope you have
obtained good quality because I hear that a great deal of bad stuff has been coming from
[England]. Please do not buy any of it for me or mix it with what is destined for our firm,
because it inconveniences me here—for your information.

I also wait to hear how you have employed the remainder of my money in buying brown
Barbados ginger and sending it here. The capers have been capturing ginger at sea and taking
it to Holland where it sells at a low price, so the prospects are that it will begin to be undercut
here as well.

Everything is going so unspeakably badly with commodities here that one simply cannot
describe it—great abundance of everything and tiny consumption, as a result of which
everything must be sold at a considerable loss. It is believed that among the fleet which has
arrived in Spain from the Indies is also a ship from Honduras, so doubtless there will be a great deal of indigo and consequently a considerable decline in price.

its return journey to Amsterdam it had been seized by Scottish capers and, as [218] indicates, after trial in the
Admiralty Courtits alleged Dutch identity was held to be proved. De Geer’s goods on board included 40 vats of
tallow.","Accompanying this is a copy of my last letter, and since then I have received yours of
22 November.
As I wrote, I have ordered the making of the pan iron in Sweden, but it will all be of the
‘O' and ‘G’ variety, for I cannot be absolutely sure that I can make the other sort (of which I
once sent a sample from here) and decided it was better to prefer the certain for the uncertain.
What is more, I know that it is good.

At Bordeaux there is lying a ship lading for London, belonging to His Excellency Gustaff
Soop,(2) named De Pasientia and about 70 lasts in burthen. On board is [the body of] the
captain who was drowned at [the Isle of] Wight, so it is being conveyed by the mate, and as
he is unknown to me please be helpful to him and do what he may want you to do and receive
the freight money. Furthermore, handle his account as if you were the captain and consider
where it would be most advisable to send him, where there might be some serviceable
freight. I am writing to him herewith to follow your orders in every particular. Please let me

know at once how much it costs to export from Bordeaux. He wrote to me from Bordeaux
that he was well and had agreed upon 42s per vat.

People are trying to persuade me (although I simply cannot understand it) that Swedish
ships must state in their passes where they are going to and what they are carrying. That may
well be true if they are coming from Stockholm, but if they are sailing for other places it is
quite impossible, because they cannot know what country they are going to before they have
acquired a cargo, and by then it is too late to write for a pass. Please let me know how you
understand it, and whether or not a captain, sailing from Stockholm to London with a pass
saying he is coming with pitch and tar from Stockholm to London, may then sail with the
same pass from London to Bordeaux and from there back to London or Hamburg?

Herewith comes a note from Johannes de Geer about the iron he has sent you this year.
The ship Drie Salmen, captain Jan Cornelis, is likely to come here from Stockholm, being
loaded there with iron and 528 coils of copper-wire by Johannes de Geer and Abraham
Wouters and consigned to Steven de Geer. Allin all, it has 2.732 slb of iron and 49 slb of wire.
Please have it registered in London as well as in Scotland if you judge it likely to journey
there. The ship De Coning David, captain Hendrick Matson, with its cargo of timber taken
aboard in Norway for the ship’s account, is to sail to either Bordeaux or Lis as the captai
thinks advisable. aie ee ete orders to enquire if there are any letters paces
for him if he should be driven into the Downs by contrary winds, so that if by chance
timber—that is, deals—are expensive with you and likely to fetch much more than at
Bordeaux, then he might as well go to London. So please write to your agent to keep an eye
open for the said captain, and decide whether you consider it a good idea for the cargo to be
unloaded in London, or in Portsmouth or [the Isle of] Wight, where it might sell readily and
a return freight of bottles? for Bordeaux might present itself. Please deliberate with the
captain about what might be best to do. Furthermore, I strongly urge upon you the
reclamation of my goods in the Muscovite ship,(4) of which I send the invoice for your fuller
information. I trust that everything is in hand and that you, through your agents, will be able
to recover them. The expenditure which I mentioned previously you will know best how to
manage and bestow as time and opportunity permits.

Herewith also goes a note to Lord Leyonberg which will likewise be useful, as occasion
serves.

letters, some written in partnership as well as individually. However, I have seen, not without
great shock and astonishment, that you have neither honoured my drafts nor Mr Beck’s,
which is in direct contradiction of your own letter in which you wrote that you would not
satisfy the £1.700 to Mr Neltorp(1) but that I could expect to draw £1.000 on you at 2, 4 and
6 months time. I have now followed your instructions and given orders to Mr Beck in
Hamburg to draw that much on you. Now comes your latest letter, refusing payment! As I
wrote to you, with my resources otherwise disposed I really do not know how I am to
interpret this, and I cannot guess what you intend by it. I certainly intend to have control over
things myself, so I must ask you, in the friendliest way, to let me know at once how much of
my resources are disposed of and to whom, so that I can have a balanced account. I must tell
you, truthfully, I do not know where I am, standing here between two fires. I proceeded on
the basis of your letters and arranged my plans accordingly, but—God help me—find myself
mistaken, so that I am thrown off my bearings.(2) You have truly done me a great wrong by
this, for which I must appeal to God. I beg you, just let me know how my assets have been
disposed of and whether they can be recovered. Whether or not you have paid others without
orders you will know best; I do not know, because I employed you as my agent. When, for
the first time, you would not pay the money to Mr Neltorp it was much the same as
protesting the bill of exchange, and after that you gave me instructions to draw up to £1.000
on you, which I did, and gave you no other orders except to satisfy Mr Beck. If you have paid
money to anyone else it is without any instructions from me and is no concern of mine. It is
quite unreasonable that a Christian man should let down another in such a way, and it is not
the way that merchants behave. You have not the least right in the world to control my
money as you think fit, without my orders. Be assured, this has struck me so hard that I and
my whole house could be ruined by it, for which you will have to answer severely before
God. My servant in Scotland informs me that he too will remit to you for my account, if you
give order to draw upon him, £300 and afterwards more. I request you then to send me an
account of how much is owing to me and how much I can draw on you, for I cannot now
continue my journey before I have your answer. Patience! I have no doubt that you will show
some Christian kindness and consider how I am dealt with since I rely so much on your letter; and now, since it is so entirely out of my hands, I must leave off. I shall look forward to your
answer at the earliest, and remain, with regards, &c.

[P.S.] I beg you, on the receipt of this letter to give Mr Beck order that he may draw on you,
or that you will immediately remit as much money as is due to him, for before that is done I
cannot set out on my journey or pursue my plans. This is now of great importance to me, so l
beg you to bear that in mind, and I shall await your reply forwarded from Mr Beck. For

Ardasse at 10s, and Aleppo at 9s 9d, which differs considerably from your purchase. This is
not the way to go about things. You say that it is worth 4d more than usual: time will tell—
particularly if it were re-sold in England and you were able to make 4d above the current
price which you paid for it! But you say in your last letter that, in the event of re-export, I can
recover half the customs-duty, so it must follow that if it remains over there I can recover
nothing, and so I cannot discover what advantage you have obtained. I also cannot see what
reason you had to make this purchase so hastily, since you yourself say that the ships were not
yet unloaded. With your next letter I shall expect the account so that I can make a record of
it—for there is no remedy for what is done, and one must be patient.

God be praised, Capt. Boys Ipsen arrived here some days ago, as you will have heard from
others. I shall procure the delivery of the bales! which you sent and let you know how I find
them in my next. Since you loaded nothing more in him there is nothing else of yours for
which he needs to sign. You did well not to buy anything more of this kind since it is being
maintained at a quite indecently high price, and if one makes a purchase disadvantageously
one cannot expect any great profit. But I do not understand why you say that you want to
buy 2 further bales of Begbesar, because I have given no new order for Begbesar since the
2 bales sent with Ipsen were bought, so please buy nothing. But, if the 2 bales of superfine
Angora have not been obtained yet, please buy them as best you can though not for more
than 5s or 5s 6d, or in their place get 2 of the ordinary fineness of the kind sent with Hendrick
Weever, for although it is not entirely white it is good and very similar and I used to prefer to
use it. However, as you say there is no lack of it, it is best that I leave you to use your own

judgement. It is not freezing here yet, so—God permitting —W. Oloffsen can still get here,
and I should be glad to have my 2 bales of Angora.

Enclosed herewith goes the second copy of the bill of exchange for £100, payable by
Caspar Kaus on the last day of this month and endorsed for payment to you. Please procure
payment in due course and place it to my account. As for what is to be done with it—I mean
to say, with regard to other things—it is good that the whale-fins are still unsold. They
should fetch more next spring since this week (God help us) four train-oil refineries were
caught in the fire and, together with much equipment and train-oil, 100.000 lb. of whale-fins
were destroyed, the damage being estimated at about RD 50.000. May God comfort the
afflicted. This misfortune will not make that commodity any cheaper in [England]. Please let
me know how much duty you were able to recover on the first consignment of whale-fins
and add to it what you agreed on for warchouse rent, so that I can make a note of it, for I
would rather not confuse it with the other consignment. Since indigo is likely to fall it is good
that you are not in a hurry to buy any. As for the proceeds of the whale-fins, I shall let you
know in a later letter what I have decided to do with them. I hope you have also been cautious
in going about to procure a parcel of white, scraped ginger for it seems likely to fall further in
price. You can see that sooner than I can and will surely have acted accordingly.

Thank you for the news about the [doicapi?] of Naples—it will be most useful.

I hope you have sent my current account. If not, let it be done. Thank you for your New Year wishes and may God confirm them in return. With hearty regards, &c.

Swedish ships bound for London, is now here—God be praised! Apparently it has been lying
in Norway, so Claus Wiens and the others should be with you now, or be likely to arrive at
any hour.

The Baltic situation is beginning to look rather darker, Holland having declared that if
Sweden does not withdraw itself from Brandenburg territory it will be regarded as grounds
for a rupture, and as Sweden is also considered as an enemy by the Allies, I fear this situation
will deteriorate further. Then all seagoing commerce from this country to the Baltic will
come to a standstill and it will only remain open for England, so one ought to give some
thought to how one is going to arrange things for the salt ships which are going to Portugal.
Therefore, let me know at once what sort of expenses would arise if I should trans-ship salt—
for example, I am expecting a Dutch ship from St Ubes, and if I should get it to run into one
or other of the English harbours (the Downs would be best, or the river Thames) and transfer
it to English ships, what sort of expenses would arise, so that I can make a few calculations?

that the ships which are lying in Elsenap? will over-winter there as the wind has not helped
them. So your iron prices should remain good. It has been freezing hard there for 4 or 5 days
but if they had the sort of weather we have been having they should soon be in open-water
again, and from the Sound they write that the winter is already past.

I very much doubt that it will come to open war between Sweden and this country. We
shall soon see which way things will turn. According to some, Brandenburg has come to an
agreement with Sweden—but time will soon tell.

If all the 20 ships(1) have been chartered to go to St Ubes for salt there should be no lack of
space for freight. Please let me know at once what freights have been agreed upon and
whether the ships have been long gone. If you can learn the net number, within 2 or 3, l am
anxious to know. Should it come to war between Sweden and this country it would be best
that most goods should go to London though some proportion should come here even
though with English ships. But what I do believe is that iron will keep its price for the
moment, because it will be some while before one will be able to get iron at Stockholm.
Through lack of sledge-trails this winter little iron will have been brought to the water-side,
though I shall have further information within a fortnight. I trust that ours will have reached
the coast, but from the principal mining-areas there will be little, for they must first make up
their stores, if they can be obtained while the winter continues.

I hope Claus Wiens has arrived safely with you and that, regarding Momma, you are not
out of pocket in salvaging the consignment from the St Jean. If you think it necessary to get
an injunction to prevent others do it only if it can be done without any difficulty, and not
unless you have received enough by that post to be satisfied. According to what they write
from Sweden it was only a rather poor lot and suspected of no good purpose.

His Highness has courteously declined the offer of the Dukedom of Gelder,(2) which is a
good thing because the community was very much against it.

If the money from the RD 2.000 bills of exchange from Momma to my brother Jan can be
found by you, please let me know for either I or Wollters at Hamburg must have it. If it
amounts to so much write to me only and I shall then get you the necessary order,

In answer to yours of 29 November and 4 December which have just arrived together, I
would have been glad to see that my order had arrived rather earlier and been followed by the
sale of my iron, but it cannot be remedied now and the consequences must be faced with
patience. In view of what you say I shall expect to see soon the account of my iron as well as
remittances, and if they have not fallen due yet please advance it at interest.

I am astonished that you should say that that sort of iron is not in much demand in
[England]. Please explain the reason to me, for it was well forged of good materials. I have
contracted to deliver some consignments in the spring so if there is something which can be
done with them in [England] I shall send an assortment of such kinds as you may be kind
enough to inform me of.

Regarding the drafts from France on [London] and from [London] on Hamburg or
Amsterdam as mentioned in my letter of 4 November, I know that double provision and
brokerage was promised, but against that it ought to be observed that from here to Hamburg
and Amsterdam the course of exchange is usually 3, 4, 5 and 6 per cent higher than in the
spring. We have found this over many years of dealing with one another, and if we then get
them to purchase in France during the winter and then draw at 2 usances, as is customary, on
Hamburg or Amsterdam, this way we can provide very speedy remittances from here. If it is
done through [London] then the time is prolonged for 2 months and in the spring it is
immediately remitted from here by the advantageous exchange, by which means the
provision and brokerage are abundantly gained. Last year the course of exchange at short
sight was 21 ML on Hamburg, payable in banco, and at 193 on Amsterdam, payable in cash.
We have now drawn good sums at 224 ML on Hamburg and at 202 on Amsterdam. I am
thinking of getting a quantity of miscellaneous goods bought in France this winter, for cash.
If I decide to allow them to draw on [London] I shall inform you in good time who it is you
are to collect their reimbursement from, and I firmly rely on you for a punctual performance.

[P.S.] Please address the letter for me here to Mr Hendrick van Felde at Hamburg so they can

As regards Hoegarden,(1) we shall have to wait for an answer to learn for what reason
Burkin & Townley make difficulties about delivering the proceeds of the iron.

The ships which are lying at Elsenap dare not depart as they have had news that capers are
entering the Baltic with Brandenburg commissions. One has passed through the Sound. It
should be declared that if he is captured he is likely to be treated as a pirate. They are now
getting the Stockholm convoy ready to escort the ships through the Sound, but that will
further delay their arrival so the iron which you have will, I hope, be sold before any new
comes, and this delay will make the price rise. I am intending to send some 3.000 slb of iron to
[England] this year, if it can be conveniently done. Indeed, I may possibly send rather more if
your iron prices are maintained. But, as against that, it may not be easy to get ships for
[England] if the salt ships are going to be at Stockholm, which I presume are now lying ready
to sail at St Ubes. Their number is not as great as you said it was, being only thirteen in all,
whereof twelve are going to Stockholm and one to Gothenburg. The ships at Elsenap will
not depart except with a convoy but we are negotiating with the Elector of Brandenburg
today. People have also complained against the sale in Zeeland of six Swedish ships with
Brandenburg commissions which does not sound too well here on the Exchange where the

regarding the funds which are entrusted to you I never meant M. de la Bistrate to dispose of
more than the £1.250, or RD 5.000 which were also ordered for Mr Becceler, and as for
what the wire sent in the Swarte Beer might yield, that is to be all sent for M. Van Racy and he,
and no one else, may draw upon it. You will have also found that M. de la Bistrate is in
agreement with me. Meanwhile M. Van Raey has been informed and says in his letter of
16 April:

‘I am sorry that you have to tell me that Widow Marescoc, in answer to your order to
place the £700 draft to your account, does not want to accept it and says that she is not
expecting any more drafts from me; also that she says she has written to M. de la Bistrate
about it and can do nothing before she gets an answer from him.’

He is disgusted with that, but I do not doubt that you have subsequently given him
satisfaction as you promised. Doubtless wire manufactures will sell more readily soon, if that
which has been lying here all winter and is now all shipped meets with no further hindrance.
But as they cannot leave before we have found convoyers and are certain how things stand
with Holland and Denmark, nothing will be going from here, and so far we have heard little
of English shipping. I also consider that the consignments of ’74 should be disposed of before
you receive these of ’75. I have decided to unload what I have lying here in 2 ships and to send
it to Hamburg in order to gain time. I shall then urge M. de la Bistrate to do everything
possible as diligently as he can to get it into your hands.

As you say, the confusion in Mr Willem Momma’s affairs is working to the disadvantage
of the brass-trade and is quite unhelpful, but he will never again be as strong as he was. I have
sold my iron to a reliable friend here and so I do not export it anymore, but I could do so for
the copper bars if the Guinea Company will make up its mind. However, as it cannot be sent
in that name or with any security for shipping this summer, unless in English ships, I shall
have to arrange things so that either itis sold and paid for here or else my trustworthy friend
in Hamburg will have to accept drafts against the credit of the bills of lading —provided that I
run no further risk once it is loaded free on board ship. And I should have to demand RD 60

at most for fine Jamaican indigo, and that I would rather have some good scraped ginger at
29-30s—vizt. for 50 or 60 sacks. I also ordered you to buy whale fins at £120 and 2 bales of
extra-ordinary fine Angora yarn, if it can be had at 5s 4-6d. This I now confirm. Since then I
find myself with your three letters of the 26th of April, 4th and 7th instant, by which I see that
the ships from Scanderoon have at last arrived at Zante and that some ships from Barbados
have arrived in the Downs—for which news I thank you, as I shall find it helpful. You should
by now have found opportunity to procure about 50 or 60 sacks of white scraped ginger at a
reasonable price and I wait to hear news of your success. If you perform my commission for
the yarn please do not buy the indigo, because all my credit balance will have gone, and as for
the bale of Ardasse silk—as I said in my earlier letter—please sell it; because it will not
perform any miracles here. You have urged me so much to make this purchase although
knowing perfectly well that there was much of it in stock and more expected. I have been out
of pocket for so long now that I shall be lucky to make any profit, so I expect you to put an
end to the matter.

I have ordered you to sell the whale-fins at £120: this I not only confirm but order you to
dispose of them at £116, since there is no prospect of an improvement. As you know best,
when one has bitten into a sour apple the sooner one gets rid of it the better!

I shall be glad to hear when the £100 on W. Robinson has been received, and it is right that
you should demand the settlement of the £75 when it is due. Accompanying this I remit you
another {100 at 2 usances, drawn on Jacques Crop and negotiated here with Samuel zum
von Brock. Please demand its acceptance, though not sooner than the next letter because the
drawer gave notice to the acceptant only three days ago.

It is not surprising that sugar is falling in price in [England] because it is very quiet here.
Business is almost at a standstill. Everyone feels alarmed at the rupture of Brandenburg with
Sweden and is reluctant to buy goods. Brown ginger can be had for 43g, and if it should fall to
16d in [London] one might be able to consider ordering some. If you are unable to effect the
foregoing order for 2 bales of super-fine Angora, please buy in its place 2 bales of ordinary
Begbesar, if it can be had for 3s 3-44, of the same quality as the bales Nos. 5 and 6 which you
last provided and sent with Boys Ipsen. They were quite satisfactory. And as for any credit-
balance which remains, please lay it out on Barbados indigo at 2s 4d—though do not include the £100 which I remit herewith. With regards, &c.","London: 32549 2 usances.

consignment in the Coninck David, and I will certainly deliver the whole amount this year,
but I cannot bind myself so precisely to the delivery-date—namely, the end of August,
especially because there is at present a general stoppage of all shipping. Ships are not allowed
to depart, which is why the Coninck David is still lying here. I have about 200 tons lying ready
at present, and when the quantity in the Coninck David arrives you can include it in the
account for the contracted 100 tons. I shall load the rest in the first ship for [London] and for
the future I propose that when I signify by bill of lading that I have loaded the iron in due
time I shall have fulfilled my obligation because I cannot be answerable if ships are held up by
embargoes, long detours or otherwise. Please have that put into the agreement.

By your next I hope to hear that the iron in Claus Wiens has been sold.

Regarding Mr Perman’s bond, I find that it is in the requisite form. It is customary in this
country to use no other ceremony in making a bond than to authenticate it with the person’s
signature and seal without using any witnesses. If there is an error in the pledge regarding the
name of Mr Leyel it cannot prejudice it, since the bond is essentially sound. I shall therefore not speak to Mr Perman unless he again asks you that I should do so. If there is anything

acceptance of the £50 bill of exchange, together with a draft for the amount and the
expenses. This I confirm. Since then I have received yours of the 18th inst. together with the
bill of lading for the bale of Ardasse and 2 bales of Turkish yarn loaded in Sybrant Clacsen’s
ship. May God bring him in safety. The account of the 2 bales of yarn, Nos. ‘B’ and ‘C’, I shall
check, and finding them correct will record my agreement and let you know. As for the
whale-fins, I expect the account by your next letter so that I can see how much I shall have
lost. I really believe the purchaser must be well-satisfied, for they were of good quality.
Regarding the Swedish copper-wire of the brands you named, as far as I can learn there
should be about 3.000 coils in town, and the said brands fetch 61 to 62 ML per 100 lb, for cash.
If any change should occur I shall not neglect to let you know. For freight charges from
Lübeck one pays 3 to 34 ML per 300 lb., less or rather more, according to the total weight.
What charges there are at Lübeck I shall write at once to find out and let you know in my
next letter. Meanwhile, I believe they are inconsiderable though I cannot say how much
more the route via Lübeck costs compared with that by sea. But it is certain that, of copper-
wares, copper-wire scldom comes here from Sweden by way of sea but rather by way of
Lübeck and Wismar. It may be useful for you to know that Wismar is further from here than
Lübeck and that people believe it will be besieged by the Elector of Brandenburg since he has
totally routed the Swedish army, capturing much artillery and all its baggage.(1) In sum, the
army is totally destroyed and, according to what they write, the general, some other great
men and the French minister, the Duc de Vitri,(2) only narrowly escaped. This will change
people’s ideas: the suspicion which I mentioned before has vanished away, God be praised.
If I can be of any service in expediting the purchase of wire or other goods, please just ask
me to gratify your commands, assuring you that it will be done as advantageously as possible.
Thank you for news of the prices of sundry goods. As regards sugar, I shall tell you in my
next letter whether I am inclined to purchase any. I estimate that you should have about £60
in hand if all my remittances are received together, which you will please employ on fine
white scraped ginger. Please see to it that it is extra-fine. That which you last sent is plump

of lading already sent to you you will be able to see what it amounts to, and when you receive
our iron please do your utmost to procure its sale, as if it were your own.

Furthermore, we thank you very much for your good and exact information about what
has been happening to commodities. We could wish that times were better so that we could
take pleasure in speculating profitably in something. We hear that on the gth of this month
the sale of East India goods by your Company was postponed until 4 o’clock on the 21st
instant. Here too our [East India Company] directors write that the day of the sale of a
quantity of East India goods has been definitely fixed. You will undoubtedly have received a
list of the cargoes of the ships which have arrived. Goods are pouring in, pell-mell, whatever
the demand. Pepper ought to sell cheaply from the Company: it now fetches 14 3/8g; cloves,
86st., nutmegs, 58st., fine cinnamon, 80st., indigo guatemalo in boxes, 6 1/2st., fine cochineal,
30s, campeachy wood, f.8 1/2, and Aleppo galls f.33.

Nothing much is happening in Swedish goods—copper-wire f.57 1/2, garcopper, f.57, for
cash; Swedish fine iron f.6 1/4 — 3/8, ditto Orgrond f.6 3/4 to f.7; coarse or anchor iron fetches

We wish we had the opportunity of being of service to you. Enclosed herein are two letters
for you from Hamburg received from Sweden. The Lord Hendrick Thuen-Rosenstrém
writes us to send with his enclosed letter the bill of lading for 42 slb of wire consigned to you,
on which he says we may draw up to RD 2.200 which he has to furnish us with by the 12th
and 19th of October. And he says we should correspond with you about what measures to
take to ensure for him the cheapest remittances from [London] or drafts from here on
[London]. Regarding this we shall wait to see your answer to know what we may do.

The first convoy from Greenland has arrived here and in their company eleven ships bring
with them 1274 whales, which is a good catch considering there are not more than eleven
ships in the convoy. And in Hamburg the latest letters say that two ships have arrived which
only had 5 whales cach, so many people conjecture that in general their catch is not large—
time will tell. Meanwhile it is believed that in September, October and November the new train-oil will be available at f.27 1/2, and fins at f.38—38 1/2. We remain, &c.",,C. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & JACOB DAVID,ENGLISH,1675,3 SEPTEMBER 1675,30 Aug. 1675,3 Sep. 1675,,621,,

By reason of the bad state of trade at present we can find little opportunity to apprentice
the said Wathing to any good merchant. We have approached several of our acquaintances
but they have no opening for one. Furthermore, we have consulted a broker who is
accustomed to arranging the apprenticeship of boys, but he told us that for him to be
accepted in a good firm he would have to find at least f-300 to f-400 per year for his keep for
four years and give security for his fidelity to the sum of f.4.000 to f.5.000, and as Mr Wathing

from the goods I requested—ginger, indigo, tobacco and galls—and buy nothing until
further order. And if by any chance you have already bought something and loaded it aboard
some of our Hamburg ships please unload it again, coûite que coûte. Even though one may have
to pay the captain some conditional freight, I beg you not to load in Hamburg or Bremen
ships since we have today received bad news from France that the King has declared war
against us and given orders in all his ports that our ships are to be seized and confiscated
wherever they may be found. We learned of this all too directly since a Bremen ship coming
from [London] laden with goods was taken in the Elbe by a Dunkirk caper. Thank God I am
not involved, and may the Lord protect us from further attacks!

Consequently I want you not to load anything you may have bought into Hamburg
shipping. If by any chance you have bought the galls you can send them here in an English
ship, but not any other goods. And in the bill of lading state that it is for your account and not
for mine, which could be useful if it is intercepted. But, God knows, how easy it is to be
innocently caught up in all-too painful losses! I have no doubt that you will help me, if it can be done without loss to yourself. Wherewith, regards, &c.

[P.S.] If you have bought some tobacco and indigo do not send it here but keep it in London
until further order. This goes by way of Amsterdam and I have also sent you the same
contents by way of Antwerp so that at least one of them may not be lost. Again, adieu.",,C. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & JACOB DAVID,DUTCH,1675,24 SEPTEMBER 1675,4 Oct. 1675,5 Oct. 1675,,315,"[P.S.] If you have bought some tobacco and indigo do not send it here but keep it in London

your next what has happened in the sale of the Marglitzer linen, and whether you think it
advisable for me to send you a further quantity. For I am sure that all English shipping will
now be fully employed and become the sole masters of the sea. If you could enquire about an
English ship of 30 to 40 lasts, which you could charter to come here for a reasonable price and
load train-oil to take from here to Rouen, it would not pay badly for I have worked it out that
train-oil bought here at 30-31 ML per quarteel(1) (which is what it is costing at present) with
all expenses, commission and freight at 17 crowns per last (of 10 quarteels) should cost 54-55
£t on delivery at Rouen where, according to the latest letters, it could fetch 65-66 £t, which
is a decent profit. And I am sure you could procure the freight for 8 French crowns per last of
to quarteels (which are contained in 20 barrels) since you say that £5—£4 10s was being
asked from [London] to Stockholm and back from there to [London], which is more than
twice as far as from here to France. You have only to take up this venture, for which little
capital is required, to make a decent profit. My brother at Amsterdam would take one-third
and you two-thirds, for I would rather sit quietly and do without commission than trade
without enthusiasm. If you decide to do something about it, hurry up, for winter draws near.
At Rouen I use Mons. Anthoine van de Hulst, a good and zealous man who has served me
well with this commodity. The voyage is a short one, the goods are not far from your
country, so you have only to make up your mind and despatch a ship.

Goods from [England] remain lying here at rock-bottom prices, so there is little
enthusiasm for getting any more. If cotton prices fell somewhat lower, as well as Caribbean
indigo, I might well decide on some. Pepper has been extremely under-sold at 14g and below, which is a poor price and gives no encouragement to order more, with which I remain, &c.

My brother, H[ermann] Olmius, tells me that two small ships have already been chartered
at Wells(1) to bring grain to me here on your joint account. May the Lord bring them safely. I
hope they are still over there at the moment as the weather has been very terrible on our
coasts with these daily north-west winds.

Grains are just as quiet as they were before, especially barley, of which the best that comes
from England is selling at £23 flem. Rye is at 136, 140 and 145 [gold guilders], wheat at 155
to 160 and 170 [gold guilders], malt at £18—£21 flem., but if exports from England come to
an end in February, as people tell me, grains will undoubtedly rise for Brabant promises to
double its demand, and so it would not be unwise to store up what is coming from you.

I am extremely grateful for the kindness you have demonstrated in wanting to continue
our correspondence through a profitable business. On my side I shall keep you informed
whenever I spot anything profitable. Barbados sugar is very scarce and since the bad news
from Barbados no one who has any will sell it, and the manufactured sugars have been sold
before they are ready so it must rise considerably, in my judgement. The last were sold at 52g
but now there is no price quoted.

The exchange on France has risen to 1034, with all the signs of rising higher, and it has been
pointed out to me that with the exchange from [London] on Paris at 543d, to give that price
there and send the bills to be negotiated here and send you returns at 365 8-0¢ (as it is today) is
a way of earning a rather nice interest.

If there is anything in which I can serve you or your friends, freely command, yours &c.",,C. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & JACOB DAVID,DUTCH,1675,20 DECEMBER 1675,22 Dec. 1675,28 Jan. 1676,,327,,

married Mrs Marescoe. I hope the Lord will bless you with mutual happiness and allow you
to live long together to salvation, in all the prosperity you could wish for.

Meanwhile, because the business is now in your hands, we shall continue our
correspondence. I wish we had the opportunity to make it rather larger but things are in such
a bad way here that nowhere is there anything to be done. Thank you for informing me of
the prices of goods. I have carefully considered each one but could not find anything likely to
be profitable. Indeed, several commodities which you mention and which must necessarily
come from [England] have been sold here at a loss. May the Lord soon give us better times
and a general peace and then trade, which is disrupted in nearly all parts of Europe, should
revive again. People are expecting that the ambassadors ofall the countries involved will soon
be meeting for peace negotiations at Nimwegen. May God grant that this long-wished-for
work may proceed so that in the coming year (in which I wish you all success and prosperity,
as above) we may be cheered by news of peace.

The two kind letters of your wife, of the 24th of September and 1st of October, reached
me in due course. I am glad to see that you sent the sample dishes to Rouen. Mons.
Schockfeuer writes me that they were safely received and I must thank you for taking such
trouble with them. It is also good to see that you obtained acceptance of the £80 drawn on
Caspar Kaus—payment will undoubtedly follow. For the £57 11s which Mr Brodridge has
drawn on I have credited your account.

I have just assigned on you a small bill of £3 3s payable to Mr John Elwill of Exeter, being
the balance due on an account. Please pay it on presentation and place it to my account,
forgiving the pettiness of it.

Now, concerning trade—as you say, thanks to the conjuncture of war England has
become the general warehouse and has nothing to complain about. Here, on the contrary,
little or nothing is happening, nearly all commodities being at very poor prices and little or
no demand for them. Regarding prices, I refer you to the enclosed price-current.1 Corn has
been very high in price here and for some time large amounts have been coming from
England. Something might well be done with that. I understand it has fallen in price at the
moment but, even so, it fetches good prices, vizt.:

It is rumoured here that the King may abolish the customs or duty which is given on its
export from England, or perhaps prohibit its export altogether. If that were done it would
cause a striking increase in price here. But otherwise I can see little signs of any change in the
immediate future, and large amounts would have to come from England before it caused any
decline—for your information.

So, if I can be of any service to you, you have only to command me, and with cordial
regards I commend you and Madame, your wife, to the protection of God, and remain, &c.","London: 35s 8g (2 usances).

the 26th and 30th of November and 3rd of this month. By these I have seen your commission
to buy 600 coils of Swedish 5-band brass-wire for 62 ML at the most, of which I have made a
note. But I am sorry to say that there is nothing to be done, as you will have seen quickly
enough! from my previous letter, for the price of wire is rising daily here and now no
Swedish wire can be had for less than 66 ML. This type is nearly all in the hands of one man
who is maintaining the price as he pleases, and the stock which he has is believed to be not
much more than 1.000 coils. None can come from Sweden for the next year, and elsewhere
not much will be worked for lack of money and credit. One should be able to obtain
Hamburg wire at 66 ML, but I fear it will rise higher.

From Rouen has just arrived, fully-loaded, Thomas Frost sailing Hendrick Weever’s ship
called De Perell, in which I do not dare to load anything although I suppose it is as safe as if it
were built in England. He last came here with it from [London] and is now, as I understand,
chartered by a friend but before that will take in some wire for Rouen—I mean, for
[London]. There have been some English ships in lading here which, for a fortnight, have not
dared to take in anything except from Englishmen. But others have taken in goods for
anyone, and they are not especially obliged to go to other places, so on that point there is no
difficulty—for your information. The Holstein ships are also passing freely. One from
Tonningen was brought in to Fryck[?] but by orders of the King was freed and his costs
repaid. People also have great hopes that our ships will again be allowed to sail freely. Philip
Muncker, in whom your wire is loaded, is completely ready and only waits for a good wind.
His ship is a galliot and has no other name. May God help him arrive in safety.

Enclosed herewith is going the account of the 150 coils of wire loaded aboard him,
amounting to £382 9s 2d, for which I debit you. Please check it, and if you find you agree
with it make a record of it. To all appearances you should do well with it. Besides Muncker
there are two other small ships laden for Rouen, which are also lying in the Elbe because of
contrary winds. Altogether I think these three ships are carrying away about 4.000 coils and
nothing of other copper wares such as sheet-copper or brass, etc, as far as I can learn. To know
the exact details one must spend something on the customs lads, which I shall do and then
inform you in my next. If you continue to want reports about this please let me know so that
it can be arranged.

The friend who has about 1.000 coils has told me that he had decided to send them to
Bordeaux, and then another 200 coils of the ‘Lily’ brand, which can still be had for 65 ML,
and to receive them without regard to the quality. For as soon as our manufacturers discover
that so little Swedish wire remains they will push up the price of their other brands. These
types [of wire] have been usually paid for immediately, and it could well be impossible—
especially in these times of rising prices—to stipulate payment by waiting for remittances
from London. And even if prices were not rising one would have to pay more if one sought
to defer it. So, if you want this commission to be performed, please enlarge your price-limit
and also give me permission to load in Thomas Frost, who will be ready in a few days. At the
present there is no other alternative. If I had performed the commission already I would have
drawn on you for my outlay, as your ordered, and consigned it to you as instructed.

The weather here is still mild, without any cold but plenty of rain and storm.

The bill of lading for the 103 sacks of ginger has been received and will be useful. I hope the
purchase of 10 sacks of cotton at 53d has also gone ahead because, since they have been bought
outright, the buyer ought to keep them. And I would judge that the hurricane in Barbados
can make little difference because, apart from this lot, nothing much from there has arrived
for a long time. If one can still get such good quality for 54d I would be content to go shares
with you in 30 sacks for which I think the price is so low that one can hardly go wrong with
them. If you are favourably disposed towards the idea please obtain such a quantity and send
it here, on the understanding that not more than ro sacks are bought for me. If you think it
advisable you can delay this purchase until the ships expected from Smyrna arrive. It sells here
for 13g and 133g in lots of 1 or 2 bales. Our ships from Spain have not yet arrived but are expected every hour. With regards, &c.

Company to buy from you 2.000 to 3.000 pieces of Marglitzer as well as other sorts of the
cloth which the English buy in Germany, we could establish an important business together. I
am eager to know if one can do anything with ‘aurum’ pigment in [England] and whether a
decent amount could be disposed of ? Sugar remains at a low price here, although people will
talk about a hurricane in Barbados, but this news has already come too often and there is a
good quantity of sugar chests here. There is also such a quantity of blue indigo that it is likely
to fall to 4g. Our ships will bring a substantial amount of indigo from Spain; all silks are lying
unsold and very cheap, and the silk-weavers cannot recover their debts outstanding in
Sweden and Denmark. I understand that good quality Smyrna cotton is available at 54d, and I
would buy a parcel of it if the Marglitzer linen were sold, so I ask you to do your duty about
this. If we allowed such a current commodity as linen to lie unsold for such a long time we
would lose all our commissions. We have to sell what arrives from Germany as quickly as
possible and make returns in cash or goods, so we have to accept most of the goods on our
own account and pay for them. If you grasped this maxim you would dispose of more goods,

contracted to deliver it to the Guinea Company in England. It is true that there are three or
four Englishmen here such as the two Townleys and others that buy it and send it to England
and I am sure that Banques has a share in it, but the idea that any monopoly should arise from
that is odious and accursed of God. No one could imagine that a monopolist has emerged,

buy from only one person. Mine could only be sold for a 10 per cent loss at 15s, and for some
time it has been selling at 18s. If you could obtain a price of 1751 might at last decide to strike a
bargain—or I could sell it here for delivery to England, for there is a demand.

I am eager to hear further news about how things are going with Barbados goods and, if
you think I should keep or sell some Barbados goods which I have bought, I beg you to
participate. Brown ginger can be had for 43g so it can hardly be brought from [England].
Smyrna cotton is definitely not to be despatched (though other sorts could be) otherwise I
might have contemplated having a good quantity from you. Pepper is at 133 g and I am sure
it will soon be at 134g. To sum up, goods are so plentiful here that sales cannot make any impression on them. May God grant an improvement and allow us to deal freely with one
another, remaining, with cordial regards, &c.

if Swedish ships cannot sail freely as long as those of Denmark are also at a standstill, but

I have learned what is happening with Swedish goods in [England] for which I thank you.

I would have answered your letters before now and sent a quantity of brass to [London] if I
had not encountered numerous obstacles due to the outbreak of war, but I have been
hindered from doing so and until recently I have been unable to obtain a complete disposition
of my goods. And since the season is now well advanced I shall have to wait until the spring
before I shall be able to ship anything. Meanwhile, I see that the prices of brass as well as of
iron are very bad in [England]. However, there is very little brass being sent from here so
whatever is being sent to [England] must be from old stocks that have been lying at Hamburg
and worked up there. It looks as if very little brass-ware will be made here this winter, partly
because of the poor prices abroad and partly because they will be short of calamine.
Consequently, these wares ought to be able to fetch a better price in the coming year if not
too much is worked up at Aachen and Hamburg.

However, the price of iron in [London] seems unlikely to improve for the present as the
greatest proportion of our exports has to be shipped to England, and the ships which have
been held up nearly all year are about to arrive with substantial amounts of iron—bringing
more than can be consumed in a whole year. For some weeks the price here has been standing
at about 24 to 25 copper dollars, excluding expenses, but seems likely to fall lower. Garcopper
is at 217 to 218 dollars per shippound, and ‘Crown’ copper-wire will cost about 573 to 58 RD
per shippound on board a free ship with all expenses paid (each RD being worth 5 copper
dollars). Pitch isat RD 40 and tar at RD 20 to 21 per last, free on board, though it cannot be
shipped from here except through the Tar Company, and someone called John Strother"" has
contracted with them for everything which goes to England. St Ubes salt is at 164 to 17
dollars per ton.

The war is making business very bad here and people see very little prospect of peace,
which we pray God may grant. But I understand that there are negotiations for the freeing of
trade between this kingdom and Holland and if they succeed it must soon be made public.

If there should be any changes in the price of brass-ware I beg you to let me know, and also
tell me how much the pieces of eight called ‘pillar’? are bought for in London and whether
they are allowed to be exported.
 If there is anything here I can serve you in, please ask freely. I remain, with heartiest

First we must thank you warmly for your New Year wishes and likewise wish you all good
fortune and prosperity.

Regarding your proposal that you join with us and our brother David to contract for all
the copper-wire that is presently being made in Sweden up to the month of November next:
although you are of the opinion that a good profit could be made for the various reasons
which you allege, we think that while it is true that little copper-wire is being made in
Sweden and that this country and Hamburg have few stocks of this commodity and there is
also little of it in London or Rouen, nevertheless they are beginning to make copper-wire in
Aachen and in Hamburg itself and are likely to continue doing so as long as it will sell well.
Furthermore, as long as this ruinous war continues consumption will never be as great as it
was and therefore we see no future prospect of any great rise in prices and (for that reason) the
market for it will be postponed. Above all, we are faring so badly with the Reenstiernas and
Momma that we have no more desire to make any contracts with them, so there is not the
slightest chance of one being made. Also we would not dare to trust our goods in Sweden,
particularly as the treaty of commerce between that Crown and this state has not been ratified
because of some hitches. We are also not keen to engage in any other business as long as the
war continues.

Meanwhile we are grateful to you for your kindness in offering to involve us in this and
other undertakings, and likewise for your news of the price of various commodities. Swedish
copper-wire is selling here for about f-64 per 100 lb. The prices of other wares you can see
from the enclosed price-current,* to which we refer. Mr William Wathing has asked us to
draw for him f-150 (that is to say, one hundred and fifty gulden) but as Madame, your wife,
has ordered us not to pay him more than f.40 or f.50 and as he has previously told us that he has no need of money we have not dared to do so without your further order. Your bill of

occurred off the Lipari islands on January 8 1676.","My last was on the 4th inst., and since then I have received yours of the 28th of January.
About the ‘O’ and ‘G’ iron, your reasoning is very good and I can well understand your
argument, but since the prices of iron are at present so low it would turn out to be rather too
expensive, and as your iron is now selling for less than it costs in Stockholm it is my opinion
that very much less will be shipped this ycar, particularly as the commercial treaty between
Sweden and this state is likely to come into effect. We shall learn the outcome in a few days.
The estates of Holland are assembling within six days and if it goes ahead there are plenty of
salt ships here ready to depart, and as a result there will be no need to have anything to do
with English ships. As the salt ships can go nowhere but here with their return cargoes freight
rates will fall and as prices are much better here the iron will also be shipped hither. However,
you must meanwhile continue to organize your sales as you have so far and as you find most
convenient, only give some thought to what I have said above.

As soon as we have the outcome of the treaty of commerce I shall let you know in case
there is anything worth thinking about with regard to salt. About 30 ships from St Ubes are
expected here any day and there are about 60 lying here in lading, several of which, if trade is
freed, will set off for Stockholm in June for f-64 to .63 per last, so there is no need to have
anything to do with English ships. However, if one could charter one for £6 or £6 5s then
one might risk sending it to St Ubes and then on to Stockholm. If you can acquire such a one!
would be content for you to charter it for us provided that it sets sail at the earliest
opportunity and so can arrive in time to join this fleet. Meanwhile, please find out if there is
anything of value over there which could be freighted for Portugal and Stockholm. There is
someone [in London] who has obtained six or seven ship-loads of salt for delivery in
Stockholm at a fixed price and who has given orders to charter ships here—indeed, if he can
obtain the right price he will buy salt here and send it on to Stockholm. I am expecting six or
seven ships in the first fleet to arrive, but whether they will be going on to the Baltic I cannot
say yet. If you were inclined to take a one-fourth or one-third share in one or two, assuming
that I can arrange for them to go there, I would give you preference before others. I seldom
take others as partners but between us it could be arranged.

I am also considering chartering one or two for St Ubes—Stockholm—Amsterdam, and if
you want to participate please let me know. I would guess that the ships which are now being
chartered will be leaving about the 5th or 10th of April, and they could be in the Baltic by
September or October, provided that there is a convoy at St Ubes. I estimate freight at about

f.64 to f.65 per English last, and f.3 or f.4 more if they are not to wait for the convoy, but one
must be careful to state in one’s orders for the Sound whether the voyage is to Stockholm,
Reval or Riga. Reval lasts cost f.2 or f.3 more; Stockholm and Riga lasts are the same as here.

As for the insurance, find out how it should be arranged over there and let me know—
with my thanks for informing me.

I shall write about the pan-iron and see that they reckon up the numbers better.

I am delighted that the suit with Mr Townley has now been settled.

I have heard nothing more from the Baltic, and from Italy the news is rather conflicting,
though all speak of a hard and skilful fight by the French, and no ships taken, though some speak of one and others of two left behind. People are also talking of a second battle, or the
beginning of one, but there is as much guess-work as certainty about the business, so we must
wait for another post—wherewith I remain, &c.",,C. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & JACOB DAVID,DUTCH,1676,14 FEBRUARY 1676,10 Feb. 1676,18 Feb. 1676,,748,,

nothing from you, but we have now received your letters of the 22nd of December last year
and the 13th of January, and have seen your proposal to bring all copper-wire under one
hand. It would be a good thing to achieve, if only one could insist on the performance of
what is promised and agreed, for in order to do it one must be absolutely sure that, in the
event of one drawing any bills, neither we nor our friends in Hamburg or Amsterdam would
run the sort of risk which has befallen us formerly and which has happened to Rosenstr6m
over the wire which was loaded in [Capt.] Kool—i.e., the bills of exchange which he drew
against it have been left unpaid in Amsterdam. In such a casc it is better to promise nothing so
that one relics on nothing, than to allow matters to turn out adversely. It greatly weakens
credit, which in these times and especially in these parts is quite tight enough already. You
can understand that better than we can explain it.

If you would be satisfied with these conditions—vizt. to advance us £3 15s or £4 sterling
on cach shippound of wire as soon as the bill of lading is despatched, and then the remaining
£12 10s or £137 as soon as we have news that the shipload of wire has passed the Sound, we
will be able to deliver into your hands all the wire which Cronstrom and Rosenstrom
produce (with the exception of those factories which are now little worked) provided tnat
you make known these conditions to all those friends in Hamburg or Holland on whom we
shall have to draw. Please draw up a written agreement to these conditions with Mr
Uppendorff. We shall also be well satisfied if you would carry the risk of the goods being
seized by some enemy action, for it will be cheaper for you to arrange their reclamation.

attorney I have been delighted to learn from you for the first time that you have entered the
bonds of matrimony with Madame Marescoe. I had only heard about it last week from Mr
Urban Hall who came to visit me here, because your letters—which would have informed
me—have not yet come to hand, and consequently I have not been able to discharge my
obligation to wish you happiness together. This will therefore serve principally to wish you
all good fortune, praying the Lord God to bless you and grant you many years of joy and
prosperity together.

I have noted with pleasure the safe arrival of Captain Goldstone and I have no doubt that
the Company(1) has taken the iron at the same price as before, as was intended, according to
your previous letter, for it is not my fault that the iron has arrived rather late. I expect to hear
by the first post whether you have agreed with the Company to deliver my voyage iron this
summer for the price of £14 5s, as you wrote in your last so that I can organize myself
accordingly. For unless that is done I doubt whether I can arrange things so advantageously
since little iron has been forged here this winter and large amounts have been bought up for
pretty high prices.

With regard to the proceeds of your salt, I have written to you at length that it would be to
your best advantage if I settled it against your current account, because the iron was dearly
bought and it was not advisable to store the salt since it could not be sold for so high a price in
the spring. I am now being offered a ship-load of salt by English merchants for 15 dollars per
ton and I see that you are thinking of consigning me another quantity of salt in the new year.
If you do so I shall dispose of it to your best advantage.

Regarding the bill of exchange on Johan Fahlgreen: it is not yet paid. I have sent your letter
to him, and I do not doubt that payment will soon follow as I have had news from Westras,(2)
where the money is to delivered, that it is daily expected there, so I hope your letter of
attorney will be unnecessary. Johan Trotzig has not yet paid up and I can get no answer from
him, though I have been told by his brother-in-law in Stockholm that he would pay shortly.
In future you would do well not to extend such credit, as you can be sure of a heap of trouble
anda long wait. I have sent the RD 100 bill of exchange on Johan Staelhaus to Stockholm for
acceptance and will give you news of it by my next. I see that Captain Guttery has arrived at
Gothenburg and I have written there to know how things stand with the goods. It is dreadful
that the posts are so unreliable and that we are mutually lacking so many letters. I cannot tell
what remittances you have made for me to Mr Van de Mortel and, since the 20th of August, I
have received no letters from him. However, I hope you have withheld the proceeds of the
iron in the last two ships in order to offset the proceeds of your salt and the sum of the bills of
exchange which, I think, altogether should just about balance each other.

I have advised you before this that Mr Perman has given orders to Mr David Leyel [in
London] to pay you the £150 relating to Jacob Fahlgreen;(3) and with regard to your claims
on Willem Momma I have not until now (with the power of attorney) received the necessary
information, but as the goods have been sold to Mr Perman (as I wrote to you before) there is
nothing which can be done now. Also, Momma says that he is no longer in debt to you, as
you perfectly well know. You would do well to obtain your claims on him amicably, like a
sensible chap.(4)

Because the money in your account has now been offset there is nothing to be said about
the purchase of brass, but if you send a consignment of salt in the spring please write fully to order what you want done with the proceeds. I commend you to the protection of God,
together with Madame, your dearly beloved;

yet appeared suspicious. PRO, SP. 95/9 f. 324.

which English shipping is going to proceed. But it seems to have been overlooked that that is
all right as long as they are chartered by Englishmen; but if they are chartered by others who
are also friends of Denmark, how are they going to manage? If they lade in English ships they
are going to need other certificates, and in my opinion that is not very advantageous for the
English ships and not many are going to be chartered by foreigners. However, as some people
were of a different opinion a few have recently passed the Sound which were loaded here, so
everything is continuing on the old basis.(1)

I have written to Sweden to inform them along the lines which you advised and all the iron
which has been kept back will be shipped for your account. I shall sell it solely to you and you
can be the guarantor or insurer against all risks and take it over on its arrival in return for a
gain of 14 per cent.

Winter is now ending over there and they will soon have open waters. There are also
about 300 slb of pan iron lying at Stockholm which I would send to you with the first
available English ships if any were lying there and if the freight charges were reasonably
cheap. But at the moment there are still about 600 slb of ordinary iron over and above that,
which I must consider first. Furthermore, I have given orders for improvements in the future
manufacture of pan iron so that the bars are more even, for they seem not to have been
turning out smooth. I have no doubt that those which are coming will be entirely
satisfactory.

As I have to pay rather a lot of Swedish bills of exchange during the month of May I now
have to ask you if can draw on you £500 at two or three usances. I would be greatly obliged
if you could accommodate me. And please let me know at once how much premium is at

great misery in a place where they have been repulsed by a Dutch regiment which lay there,

January and the 3rd of March, which I ought to have answered much earlier but since there
has been little business to be done this winter I have been out of town for most of the last three
months, settling matters with my debtors in other places and thus they have been left behind,
so I beg you to excuse the delay.

From the first letter I have learned with joy of the marriage which you have made with the
widow of the late Charles Marescoe, for which I heartily wish you much happiness, blessings
and prosperity as well as long life and lasting contentment.

Further, you have been pleased to share with me in that, as well as the two following
letters, the news of what is happening in trade at [London] for which I am obliged but I must
confess to you that current market prices here are so restricted that it is impossible to gain
anything by sending things here, unless one has some other advantage (which is unknown to
me) or has the good luck of a favourable change in prices while the goods are on the way. For
the last nine months we have done nothing in Swedish trade because no Dutch ships have
been able to sail there, and this year will be still worse because the King of Denmark is
beginning to detain English ships and to check whether they carry Swedish goods. People
have been talking for a long while about a treaty of commerce between the Swedish crown
and this state and saying that Dutch ships going there will be allowed to pass the Sound
unmolested, but we have seen little result from all this and not much reliance is to be placed
upon it.

Finally, I must thank you most humbly for your kind offer, whereof shall take advantage
if opportunity occurs, and in return offer my unworthy person to share in the honour of your commissions: you can assure yourself of good and punctual service. The prices of all sorts of

casks were very dry and of much worse quality than the samples he had seen, so he rejected
them and did not want them except for 6s. At last he offered 6 1/4s, at which price I sold them to
him. I could scarcely bring myself to agree, seeing that the price is miserable and does not
leave much above 9 per cent profit, but your urging to sell at the earliest opportunity and the
fact that others are selling moved me to do so. And in my opinion I did well, for various
people have it for sale and much more is expected. We would have done better if ours had
arrived earlier, for a friend of mine has had 22 casks which he received with an earlier captain
and he sold them at 6 5/8s. There is also news from England that another ship from the
Bermudas is expected this year which will bring a good quantity and I believe this must be
the reason why good quality stuffis already being offered today at 6s which puts that which
was bought for 6 1/2[d] in London in a bad position. I wish you had not also bought this last lot,
though if it is thoroughly good we must see if it cannot be sold perhaps for a rather higher
price. Among those which I sold were various rolls which were so rotten and completely dry
that they could be crumbled into powder, and the purchaser consequently claimed a 30 |b.
deduction. How far we should agree with him let me know in your next. As soon as the
captain completes his loading the account will be sent with him.

If the campeachy wood which I asked for has not yet been bought please forget it for I fear
that much has arrived with the galleons in Spain and it may perhaps fall lower in price. If the
fleet from Virginia has arrived I would be favourably inclined to go halves with you in a trial
quantity of Virginian leaf. If you decide to do so, please buy 6.000 to 8.000 lb. for our account
at a price of about 4 1/2d, making quite sure that it is good quality and undamaged. You must
also see that it is bought advantageously at the best time, for unless one makes an
advantageous purchase there is no chance of making a profit these days. I shall be glad to learn
now and again what is happening with regard to ginger.

This is in answer to your undated letter, though from the account accompanying it I find it to
be of the 13th of January. I am now still lacking your letters of the 3rd of September, and of
the ‘16th instant’, which I think must mean December. I have safely received the account of
the wire sold from [captains] Marten Olofsen, Roelof Anders and John Wilmot, together
amounting to RD 1.720. I have checked it and recorded it, but am extremely astonished that
you allowed the wire to lie around when you could have made between £6 3s and £6 5s for
it yet did not sell a single coil for eight months. Now you are selling it for the scandalous price
of £5 16sto £5 18s, and that for 4, 5 or 6 months time! I had much rather that you had left it
lying, because in these difficult times it cannot be delivered and the ships which left here last
autumn did not have very much aboard. This year even less will come as very little was
manufactured—about 25.000 coils less per annum than are made in time of peace, for your
information.

You have also not sent me any account of what was sold between October 1674 and
January 1675, being about 2.000 coils, which I shall await, as well as the account of the coils
sold in Rouen which you have not sent me. I expect the loss to be settled, for the longer one
delays the worse it is, and I am surprised that the insurers of the Caritas lay claim to the full
insurance. It is quite true that they ran the risks while the ship was lying in the Daalders and
were liable, and also for the risks of going to London when, because of the war, the goods
might have been lost. I am not liable to pay for the insurance to London, and I ask for nothing
more than what is just and fair. You can judge it impartially yourself.

You say, regarding the said goods, that you have sent a power of attorney because
someone has assured you that Hiebenaer is making some claim on them. Whoever wrote that
to you has deceived you with lies and it is quite unnecessary for you to meddle with it and
send powers of attorney, for I myself shall answer for it here.

Regarding the latten, black kettles and basins, please make an end of them and do not
haggle about the price. I was influenced by the advice I got from [England] on April 11th,
1671, when someone else stated that 400 shippounds of black or yellow kettles could be
disposed of every year, and perhaps even more, but I see now that one cannot rely on such
advice.

I am also not a little surprised that you remind me to take care that I reimburse you for your outlay, yet I have not received any account and do not know what your claims are. I

I am delighted that John Clark arrived and I shall be glad to hear how you find his cargo. It

I have always feared that whenever so many goods arrive in [England] all of a heap they
would fall in price, but I hope they will do rather better if the whole lot is bought up. Iron
prices should stay steady this year as there will be much less made than last year because many
forges have been unable to work for lack of water. And the iron will be late in arriving since
there have been hardly any sledge-trails for it up-country.

January and 5th of February, with information about what has been happening with regard
to Swedish trade, for which I thank you.

Your considered opinion concerning copper-wire I judge to be well-founded, and by
buying it up you will make your intentions clear and be able to control the market according
to your desires. But as for your proposition that all the copper-wire which may be made up to
November next year should be placed in one person’s hands and not be allowed to cost more
than £5—£5 5s in London, there is not the slightest prospect of it for the simple reason that
the creditors of the ‘Three Crowns’ and ‘Crowned N’ works have to contribute payments to
help the works get going, and as a result the owners are not free to dispose of the brass which
is produced at their works. Secondly, all the brass which has been made here for the last year
has cost not less than 245 to 250 dollars per shippound, because the high price of copper has
been supported by the launching of the copper coinage, and it could not cost less than £5 145
in London, with all expenses included, even if it could be bought here for 250 dollars. Indeed,
that price has been offered in vain and it looks as if it will rise higher still as soon as the ships
come to be loaded because little has been produced —the ‘Three Crowns’ works having been
at a standstill for a whole year, and the ‘Crowned N’ works going slow and at a standstill for
the last two months. For the last fifteen months I have had about 470 slb from the ‘Three
Crowns’ works lying at Norrköping which I was prevented from exporting by last year’s
troubles. It consists of about 313 slb of copper-wire, so slb of latten, 50 slb of black kettles,
30 slb of ‘English’ kettles, 10 slb of ‘Scottish’ pans and 5 slb of pots. Mine was part of a
consignment which should have gone to London but which cannot be sent now as I
understand there is a restrictive order in force requiring one to declare that the goods loaded
in English ships are for English accounts. It is good of you to offer to take on all the risks and
to reclaim the goods as if they were your own, being consigned in your name, in return fora
reasonable consideration, but you have not stated how much and these wares can only bear a
little. If it could be done for 1 per cent above the ordinary insurance rate I might well agree to
it; at 2 per cent there are plenty here who could do it but I would find that too much. If you
would charge only 1 1/2 per cent on top of the sales-commission and order my brothers at
Amsterdam to arrange the insurance and manage the expenses so as to avoid the deduction
which London insurers make in case of loss(1) I shall be interested to hear your opinion and
await your decision at the earliest opportunity. If by any chance some shipping-space should
turn up and permit the despatch of some goods on these conditions the insurance should be
calculated on the basis of £13 1/2 sterling per shippound and the sale made in as short a time as
possible so that no bad debts can arise.
Notwithstanding the fact that iron is fetching little abroad the price here is being
maintained at 24 and 25 dollars per shippound.

price of iron remains at 24 to 25 dollars. Copper-wire is at 258 to 260 dollars per shippound

nothing from you so this will serve to inform you that I have received the balance due from
Mr Fahlgreen, being 1.260 dollars, less 1 per cent for the cost of transport, which you will
please make a note of. Lord Axel Oxenstierna has now arrived here and I will pay his bill of
exchange at the rate of only 21 marks lübs per rixdollar. The RD 15 bill of exchange drawn
on Mr Tibou he has refused to pay saying that he has already given the money to someone
called Mr Mollié,! but if in fact it has not been paid he will honour the bill.

By my next I shall let you know what can be done about brass-wire and whether or not I
can employ the proceeds of your bills of exchange on it, as you ordered. As for iron, I can see
no advantages for you at presentas it is dear, so if I cannot achieve anything according to your
instructions I shall remit you the remainder of the money. I do not believe I shall be sending
much iron on my own account this year as it can be sold here at good prices. Furthermore, the
English merchants here will no longer allow any Swedish property to pass under their names,
and the poor prices in [England] rob one of any desire to send any. The [Royal African]
Company ought to take the consignment in the Coninck David at the previous price, as was
agreed, for the fact that the iron arrived rather late was not my fault. As a result I have not
much desire any more to contract with them.

From the accompanying letter you can see what Mr Perman has written to me about the
£150. Regarding Antony Pingar, I have found out that there is little or nothing good to say
since he has married a woman of ill repute. I have sent the documents on to Stockholm to see
if anyone will take on the case, but it cannot be done without money, and for that I have no orders. It is also to be feared that one is throwing good money after bad. With regards, &c.",,C. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & JACOB DAVID,DUTCH,1676,14 APRIL 1676,12 Jun. 1676,17 Jun. 1676,,386,,

which brass could be smelted]. RA, Stockholm, E.2475 (Jacob Momma’s letter-book, Dec. 1667-July 1669) pp.
446-9. However, it is not clear from this reference or the next [305] what kind of clay W. Momma required.","My latest letters to you were on the 16th of February by way of Stockholm, on the 1st of
April by way of Gothenburg and on the 4th instant through Stockholm. I have sent copies
with each one and refer you to them. I have since received your welcome letter of the 10th of
April, from which I more fully understand your discourse about the free passage of ships and
what arrangements you have organized and, above all, that I should speak with our friends
here about bringing all the wire into your hands to prevent undercutting. And since your
competitors have now all been bought out and all the wire is only in your hands the price has
risen to £6 ssand could well be held at £6 tos, and before the end of the year you will have
no difficulty in getting £7—which makes it all the more surprising to me that you have not
been able to sell my wire for more than £6 and have left if lying for eight months and have
been selling it quite disgracefully although you knew that this change could be achieved and
in spite of my warnings that it could well have been kept another two or three months!

Lalso find that I have no relevant answer to my letters, for in those of September 1675
(which you have received) I wrote about the account of the wire sold by you at Rouen and
making good the loss, but to that I have had no answer and there still remains due to me the
account of more than 2.000 coils which were sold in 1674. I shall expect both accounts so that
I can see how to organize myself. You crave only that all these goods should come into your
hands but do not consider the risks which the owners would have to run, for even if one had
them fully insured it would still be unsafe because one cannot be certain nowadays that bills
of exchange! would arrive on time. If you want to get all the wire into your hands you must
do it differently and send a servant here who can acquire it and also pay out the money and
declare them to be English goods. Otherwise all this writing is in vain, as I have said to you
before.

There are now a good many ships from England arriving at Stockholm, but I doubt that
they will make any great profit, selling salt at 11 to 12 dollars per ton, and even if they gain
handsomely on the incoming cargoes I suspect they will have to sit still and wait for the
outgoing ones, for they cannot load their ships with anything but tar, pitch and iron, of
which there is plenty and which will be so abundant in England that it will be unsaleable. But
not as much wire will be coming as is wanted because little is being manufactured here, and
without some unforeseen events there is likely to be a lack of calamine and clay which this
country does not produce and without which the works cannot go on. It was only a little
while ago that you said that the clay, which I asked for and you sent, was of small importance—but to me itis extremely important, and having nothing more to say I remain,

clays had been long prohibited in England, most recently by Acts of 1660 and 1662 (12 Car. II. c. 32 and 14 Car. II.
c. 18) but the penalties fell well short of death!","On the 4th of June I wrote letters to you by way of Stockholm and on the same date by way
of Gothenburg, which I hope have come to your hands and to which I refer. I have since
received, by way of Gothenburg, your welcome letter of June 16th in which there is much
that requires an answer.

I have grasped what you relate at length about the sale of the 1.720 coils of wire which you
included as sold in three accounts of 1675 (in September, October and November) and on the
5th and 13th of January 1676, but I have plenty of reason to complain about it for since the
15th of January 1675 you have scarcely written to me about what has been sold except to say,
in the account dated 13 January 1676, that since 15 January 1675 (when I last had news) my
copper-wire has remained lying unsold while others have been selling at £6 and £6 2s for 2
months time, at £6 4s and £6 3s for 4 months time, and £6 5s at 6 months time. And
according to your recent letter of June it has continued selling since then at £6 4s and 5s and
£6 3s and £6. I can hardly accept your excuse that there were such large amounts of wire
from others and that theirs was preferred before mine, for in several letters you have said that
most of it has been bought up, that very little was out of your hands and that you soon
expected to have your ‘turn’ and intended to sell at higher prices. Take a look at your letters
from the beginning of 1675 up to June—I have had little news since then that it has been my
‘turn’! It is as if you had no wire of mine in your hands. And now I have unexpectedly got the
account of the 1.720 coils sold as above, so you must not find it strange that I complain
excessively. I shall not clear your account of the debt but make a note that you have
administered such an amount. And as for the wire which was sold in 1674, you say the
account was sent at the proper time but I cannot find it in any of your letters, much less find
any mention of it. Now I have got the copy of three accounts, but in none of the three is the
time stated from which you have credited my account. In the one concerning 900 coils I have
nothing to say except that you have made an error of 7s 3d in the parcel sold to Elizabeth
Packer on the 27th of November—in place of the £158 1s 11d which you put it ought to be
£158 9s 2d. In the other account, of 700 coils, I find the weight is rather less than it ought to
be and the time for some parcels should be altered from 1 month to 6 or 7 weeks.

But the third account, of 870 coils, I cannot find acceptable at all, since you state them to
have been sold without putting any date or time, and also without naming any person but
simply ‘to sundry’—which is not a style that ought to be used. And, above all, these 870 coils
are over 10 centner short of their weight—which you will please have checked and then give
me some pertinent explanation.

I have now also received the account of the 360 coils of wire sold in Rouen, and in that it is
stated that you have to make good £7.728t 7s 11d for the proceeds and that you have made
good to me alone £7.575¢ tos 6d. How that comes about you will know best, and about the
compensation for the damage on the ship Samson (where there is also 7 centner short on the
weight of the kettles) there is nothing mentioned—which is all taking too long.

lintend to do nothing about Townley’s claim, for it is an unjustifiable claim, as all upright
and impartial persons can judge. It is the same with the insurance on the Caritas, on which the
insurers will hand over no more than the premium, while the insurers in Holland in a similar
case raised no questions.

The reason why you have had the RD 2.000 bill of exchange returned is—you say—
because you have little or nothing for me on account, alleging further that there is a bad debt
owing by someone called Harrison for goods sold in the time of your partnership with Mr

Joye. But I find that that item was made good to me over four years ago in my current
account and as no mention of it was ever made it does not convince me. It is no wonder that
you have nothing for me if you handle things in such a manner!

I quite understand that it is not permitted to export earth(1) on pain of death—one cannot
afford to run such a risk. It is abundant in our area around Aachen and also in the Liége
country and in France but the war prevents us from being able to get any here.
People have been saying for a long while that the trade treaty with Holland would be
concluded, ratified and exchanged, but since then it has remained quiet. Meanwhile the
English alone have the trade of Stockholm, though I believe it will be of little profit for they
dispose of their goods at Stockholm reasonably cheaply and on their return cargoes (and
especially iron) they will lose a great deal. They behave in the way you described—as soon as
they have acquired their cargoes they are forced to sell in order to pay for the freight and
expenses, but it is not for someone like me to object—one must know how to make a profit
until this squall is over, for like the last I do not think it will endure for long and as soon as the
shipping returns I believe things will go for me as they did before. I can send nothing as long
as these wars last, nor would I advise you to send anything to my son unless you also send a servant who could declare them to be English goods. I remain, herewith, yours &c.",,C. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & JACOB DAVID,ENGLISH,1676,23 JULY 1676,12 Sep. 1676,12 Sep. 1676,,1060,,

4 De Geer has omitted £50 in one of these bills.","I arrived back here about two days ago, and before my departure from Middelburg yours of
the 1st instant came safely to my hands together with an account of the iron received from
Willem Mynart,(1) with which I have recorded my agreement.

I was not happy to see that a quantity of ‘OO’ iron has come to London despite the fact
that I was afraid it might arrive by mistake. My nephew, Trip, bought a quantity at
Stockholm for delivery here, as was agreed, but later it slipped his memory so that when he
heard that iron was much dearer in Stockholm than here he gave orders for it to be sold,
forgetting to write that it was not to go London, and that is how the mistake occurred. I
would have gladly remedied it, but it was too late. You can judge if the people will make
anything with it, having paid 26 1/2 to 27 dollars per shippound in Stockholm.

Before my departure from Middelburg I wrote to tell you to insure the iron in the
Zebulon, captain Joseph Pyll,(2) for £1.000 sterling which I trust has been completed. The said
captain had rather severe weather in the Baltic and lost his mast and came to the roadstead off
Danzig to refit, according to my nephew Trip there who left from Stockholm in his
company. I hope he has now got fine weather so that we can soon expect him. Boor writes to
me that he sent the letter containing the bill of lading by way of Gothenburg so it may soon
arrive here or reach you. There was also some pan-iron expected which would also be sent to
you with the first available ship. No other iron will be sent to you for the present, so what
you have should hold its price. Iron is scarce in Sweden and all that has appeared is now being
shipped here.

We are trying to do something about getting the posts going and have sent orders to the
Resident Lemere(3) to speak with the King of Denmark about it, but he could not comprehend
why it was not taken too well here, knowing that one can drive no trade without letters. We
have decided that if Denmark does not show any understanding we shall pay them no
subsidies until the posts are going freely again, and I believe the Danes will soon change their
minds.

I have today received letters from Stockholm dated 14/24 August which mention that
Captain Pyll lay ready to depart, so if nephew Trip had not written that he had come to
Danzig I would assume that it must be another ship—unless there are more captains with the
same name.

Herewith goes the bill of lading, which is the fifth. The others have to date not yet arrived.
Some more iron will be loaded with the first available ship.

I suppose it will not inconvenience you if I drew against this cargo while the present rate of
exchange is rather high, for cash is quite scarce now that the ships from Sweden are about to
arrive.

By the next I shall write to the Lord Douglas in case he comes to speak with you. Please tell
him that I have today drawn on you £651 17s 3d according to the details below,(4) which are
recommended to your care:

Concerning the wine cargo which I mentioned before, I shall now only say briefly—that the
freight must cost no more than 5s or 10s more (or less) than others; that one must look for a
captain who is known to be an enterprising seaman, a man who can judge a situation well; the
ship must not be too big and its bills of lading must be correct for the Baltic. Let the insurers
take care of the cargo, worth 5.000-6,000 £t. I suppose the premium from here will be
9 or 10 per cent, or rather less. Lacam at Bordeaux is good.

There is little good wine to be sent from here, but from France nonetheless the expenses are
just as large. I shall enlarge on all this by my next. If you think it is a good idea give such
orders as you think fit. I cannot tell whether it will turn out well, without any mishap. If the
ship is rather bigger load it also with such new goods as are in demand from there, but make
sure they are good things which are loaded. My time has run out so I must break off until the next post. Meanwhile, I remain, &c.",,C. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & JACOB DAVID,DUTCH,1676,25 SEPTEMBER 1676,19 Sep. 1676,6 Oct. 1676,,767,,"£200 (at 2 usances) to Ab. Gerard’s order;

from which I have seen that Smyrna cotton is not to be had below 5 1/2d and that consequently
there was nothing that could be done about my commission. So one must be patient and let it
rest for the moment, I have recorded my agreement with your account of the indigo and
likewise with that for two bales of Ardasse, so there is nothing to say arising from these. Your
cask of Jamaican indigo has turned out well, which its purchasers cannot deny, but they will
not agree to give a higher price for it. However, I shall do my best with it and if there is
anything to report I will let you know.

William Cutler has arrived here, God be praised! I shall now procure the receipt of the two
bales of silk and try to sell them as soon as possible to our maximum advantage. I see you have
no great inclination to sell it for time, but it may not be possible to avoid and if I decide to do
so I shall stand surety for you, not doubting that you will allow me 1 per cent for it, for it is
customary here for people to deduct 4 per cent for selling and standing surety for Italian silks.
However, to encourage our relationship I shall answer to you for 24 per cent.

The campeachy wood went for ML 7 8s, which is a poor price. A friend of mine received
a quantity with Cutler’s ship which cost him ros in [London], so I hope yours will not cost
more, otherwise I could not support you. Swedish garcopper can be bought for RD 58 and is
selling in Rouen for 74£t which does not leave much margin in my opinion, so I may not
perform your commission. The expenses here are about the same as on the wire, so you can
best work it out. Of Swedish wire there is none to be had and, as I said in my previous letter,
there is also none arriving at Lübeck. If it was here it could be fetching 68 ML and Hamburg
wire fetches 70 ML per centner, so in that commission there is also nothing to be done. About
250-300 coils of Hamburg wire have been shipped to Bordeaux. For Rouen I have not been
able to learn quickly what has been shipped. The expenses on wire, here and at Lübeck, are
about 73 ML, not counting the freight from Sweden to Lübeck, per shippound of 320 lb.
Most of it is brought by way of Lübeck—it seldom comes directly, for your information. A
great quantity of iron has arrived at Lübeck which may weaken the market rather, but of
copper and wire people think little will come out of Sweden this year because of the large
duty and the unfreedom of their ships.

If my 4 barrels of blue-dye are still unsold, please look after them, for one hopes this
commodity will rise in price because henceforth only a limited quantity will be made. If you
have achieved anything for me with regard to the [East India] Company I expect to hear.
Please buy another 4 cases of indigo guatemalo at 2s 8d or below and, if it is possible, pour out
some so that you are not deceived, or otherwise check one barrel thoroughly to see if it is a
high-quality blue. If it is fine, without anything false or mixed with powder, please take it
and inform me ofit. Your draft of RD 50 in specie will be promptly paid and debited to you.
Concerning the information about the position of Sirps, I am grateful to you. A friend here
has also had letters from him, but the letters in which he gave orders for his reimbursement
failed him. However, he does not doubt that he will give him complete satisfaction,
wherewith cordial regards, &c.

Norrköping this year there has been absolutely no shipping-space available for any
destination and because of the dispute between the Crown and Queen Christina over the
customs duty no goods have been able to come here from Norrköping. I have been waiting
in vain for some opportunity to ship out something. There is now going there a small English
ship called the John & Edward, captain John Stabler, from Bridlington, which is chartered for
the account of Francis Townley and going from there to the river Thames where it will
receive orders from Townley whether it is to travel to Rouen or unload at London. But lam
quite sure that it will sail off before you can load any goods in her. There is a quantity of brass
loaded in the said ship, ordered by Mr John Greene, who wants it insured in [London], and on
my recommendation it is addressed to you. Please serve him to the best of your ability. You
will receive orders from him about the amount of the premium to recover from my brothers
in Amsterdam.

I understand that another English ship, with salt, is expected shortly at Norrköping. If it is
returning to London you can expect a quantity of brass with it. It is a troublesome business
that one can hardly succeed in loading anything, If it were not so late in the year I would
make up my mind about getting a small vessel to come from England, and I would have done
so already if I had not been given hope that the dispute over the customs duty would have
been settled by now.

The coarse cloths called ‘dozens’ have been selling at a good profit this year, likewise the
calicoes, such as bleached ‘moorees’, ‘hummums’ and ‘addaties’ and all kinds of French

about the request I made, in offering my son to be taken into your counting-house. I must
confess that I did not know the conditions which prevail in England as well as I now
understand them from you. Things are arranged quite differently here. It is true that in some
cases money is given by those who are widows, who wish to continue living with their sons.
For they have little knowledge of places abroad and are unwilling to send their children
away, and since they are people of means they are quite happy to give a sum of money so that
they can be accommodated and keep their children at home. Some are taken on for
nothing —or, at least, without money—as we did with our servant Claes Bene who, as we
know, corresponds with you about the purchase of his goods. For six years he served us for
nothing, and for the other two years that he was with us we gave him RD 100 per annum.

Meanwhile, I see that you are very willing to take my son and prefer him before others
who have been offered to you if I will engage him for seven years, give surety for his honesty
in the sum of £2.000 sterling and pay £300 sterling for seven years. Regarding the first two
points I could well consent, namely that he should serve seven years and I could give security
of £2.000 for fidelity for of that lam entirely confident. But to pay £300 sterling in addition
I think is rather too much, seeing that there is no trade and very little going on, so that our
lives are very constricted. When some improvement is expected I would be very willing to
give £200 flem. or RD 500 in order to have my son in your firm, but since you say you have
offered to do his pleasure for the former condition of £300 sterling but not for £200 flem. or
RD 500 I must thank you for your kindness. In passing I have since discovered that, while
young men in [England] do give money, there are other conditions which you did not
mention—that those who have served out their apprenticeship and carried themselves well
and want to remain with the firm can enjoy a half-share of the commissions and several other
conditions, which you know better than I do. It means that they can soon earn back the
money they have paid for their service. What you decide about this I hope to learn in due course. With very friendly regards, I remain, &c.",,C. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & JACOB DAVID,DUTCH,1676,10 OCTOBER 1676,18 Oct. 1676,20 Oct. 1676,,454,,

prices at which the East India Company goods were sold, as also the prices which other goods
are fetching in [London]. We thank you for all your trouble but, as we have often said, we
can see nothing profitable among the one or the other, for there is no demand and the
exchange rate on [London] remains high. Prices are being much undercut here by the
English, as well as others, so if one wants to invest one’s money one can do it here more
advantageously than in [England]. We still have the last 265 sacks of ginger which we
bought, lying here unsold with other lots, and are negotiating to buy another 400 sacks here
which we are being offered at 4g per lb. with 8 2/3 per cent discount. Among them are many
sacks of white ginger and we are offering 3 3/4g on the above conditions. Whether we can
obtain them for that a few days will reveal. As for what else trade has to offer, pepper is going
very cheaply in Holland. We are expecting a quantity for ourselves. Campeachy wood is
cheap and we have been considering speculating in it for some time but cannotas yet make up
our minds. It fetches only 7 3/4 ML per 100 lb and the old was 83. Grains are continuing to sell,
such as rye at RD 57 to 58 and fine wheat at RD 61 to 62 per last. The wheat is likely to be
cheaper than the rye in future. Insurance on English ships has jumped because with every post
one hears of them being intercepted and held, and the Germans will hesitate to be as liberal
about lading in them as they have been. To sum up, things are daily getting worse for trade, and we must have patience and wait for the amendment of our lives. With friendliest regards,

G[ ? ] on his arrival. In a similar case I would be likewise at your service.

I further see that you have not been able to achieve anything in the purchase of tobacco,
since nothing good was obtainable below 6d. It is true that I see no prospect of it falling here
for the moment, but I do not think it would be advisable to spend more than sd per lb. for
there would be nothing we could do with it when the expected ships arrive in [London] and
good quality stuff is obtainable at sd. I refer you to my foregoing letter.

You report campeachy wood at 10s, at which price there is nothing to be done, I find.
However, I am told that it is being sold for 9s in [London] so if you could buy it at that price,
free on board, and will take a half share, I would gladly take the other half of 25.000 lb. on
trust. It sells here for f.6 3/4 per 100 lb., but with such a quantity one might have to settle for f.6 1/2.
English copperas fetches f.6 1/4 to f.6 1/2 per 100 lb. and I would be glad to learn what it costs in
[London], for there seems to be something to be done with that as well.

Thank you for news of ships arriving in [London] as well as of what is happening in trade.
Little is happening here. Bermuda tobacco comes here seldom and at present there is none in
town. If any should come it would not fetch above 4 or 5 stuivers per lb. Brazil tobacco in
varieties are from 9 to 10 stuivers per lb. to 124.and 13 stuivers for the best. Indigo guatemalo
is at 28 to 30 stuivers per lb., Pernambuco wood at f.34 per 100 lb. Roman alum 47s per 100 lb
and English 33s. Cochineal is mostly at 303s per lb. Aleppo galls are f.34 per 100 lb., Smyrna
ditto, f.27 1/2. Senegalese gum is at [blank], White Brazilian sugar, 10 to rxg per lb., and
muscovadoes 8 1/2 to 8 3/4g per lb.; Barbados sugar 6 1/2 to 6 3/4g per lb. and Nevis 6 3/4 to 7g per lb.
Lead is 24s [per 100 lb.], tin f.45 [per 100 lb.]. Brown ginger f.11 1/2 per 100 lb.; white ditto f.13.
Apulian oil £57 lem. per tun; Seville ditto, £56; Port Oporto and Lisbon £53 to £55.
Zante currants f.16 per 100 lb. Milanese rice 47s per 100 lb. Cardamon 444 stuivers per |b.;
cubebs 8 1/2 stuivers. Ardasse silk, 16 to 16 1/2s per lb. Because of the great differences in Turkish
yarn there is little I can say about them. Ordinary Angora is at 3 1/2 to 5s per lb.; better sorts at 6
to 10s per lb., and the best from 12, 13 to 155 per lb. Begbesar from [hole], Camel hair is in
reasonable demand here. Aleppo fetches from [hole] to 33 and 34 stuivers per lb.; Smyrna
from 28 to 29 and 30 stuivers. Smyrna cottons are 10 to 12 1/2g per lb.; Cyprus cottons 12 to 13g
per lb.; Barbados yellow [cotton] 15 to 16 1/2g and white ditto 14 to 15 1/2g per lb. The best
nutmegs now sell for 55 stuivers per lb.; poorer quality fetch 50 stuivers; cloves are
804 stuivers and mace 16 1/2 to 18s per lb.; cinnamon from [hole] to 60 and 70 stuivers. Madder,

per 100 lb. Since I sent you the notice of our [East India] Company prices other wares are
selling as in the enclosed notice and in Zeeland they began their sale yesterday.

The English draperies trade is absolutely at rock-bottom here since there is no demand for
the goods and they are selling at very low prices. The smallest white pack-cloths of 28 yards
length have been sold for from £11 to £11 flem.(1) per piece, according to quality, and I
notice that white northern kerseys are now reasonably current, fetching from f.18 to f.22 per piece. Mixed grey kerseys are from f.20 to f-22 per piece, for your guidance. If you see any

coming freely from France brought a supply. However, if yours bee good it may sell for
about 8s sterling per hanegas, whereof 2 bushells inglish make one, and 6 per cent losse more.

works.
2 Jean Lacam, of Bordeaux.
3 In the tradition of his father, patron of Comenius, Steven de Geer seems to have financed young scholars on
visits to Oxford. Nigrinus had drawn £40 on David by 12 October 1676.","My last letter was on the [blank]. Since then I have received yours of the 10th instant.

Our people in Sweden have no need to sell our iron without orders. What came last year
was due to a misunderstanding, as I explained to you.

As for the 1.500 slb, it is neither “O’ nor “G’ iron. My brother Emanuel, who also has
works in Sweden, always sells his iron in Stockholm. It may well be that your friend has
bought some of that iron, but I believe he will have paid dearly enough for it. It is an iron
which always come here as a rule. It is also an Orgronts iron, but he will first have to make
people familiar with it. The smiths always mark it ‘L' and there is none in England.
Everything that was made last year came wholly here, and next year’s production has not yet
been sold. He is accustumed to sell all his iron to one man in one place, and this year nephew
Trip has had it. He makes about 6.000 to 7.000 slb per annum, so this 1.500 slb must be old
stuff. If the purchaser is wise he will have that iron sent here. It would yield him more than the
19s [per cwt.] in London for it is familiar here.

About the time that the ships were coming out of the Sound they passed the Nachtegael
which had been forced by contrary winds to run into Norway. Since Mr Lacam? cannot
achieve anything about chartering a ship we shall have to let it lic. It would not have been a
bad voyage, arriving before the winter, but in the spring it would not be advisable for there
will be quite enough provided from here.

I trust the price of wine will change considerably for it is low here but rising, and is doing
so in Sweden, so I believe the English will not be fetching so much in the coming year. Those
who were there with salt ships this year will lose their appetites for going again, and because
Dutch ships now have free passage there will be no English ships which can sail there at that
price. One can freight from here to St Ubes to Stockholm and back again for less than f-52 per
last of 18 tuns, if delivery is at Stockholm. I would judge that freight-rates at Stockholm will
be low next summer and one can already reasonably foresee that the price of salt will not be
very high.

About this commodity, I have been speculating that because it is forbidden in Portugal to
come to St Ubes in ballast there are few ships here which want to go there, and if that remains
the case while winter comes on I might find that not many ships have been chartered to go
there, and then it might be worthwhile chartering one or two English ships, if they can be got
for less than £6 sterling, in view of the fact that with few English ships coming to Stockholm
freight rates at London may be quite cheap. I shall thus be glad to learn from you at what
price one should be able to obtain them. If one could succeed in getting them for £5 it would
be tolerable, even allowing for the fact that because of the high rate of exchange the money
would be worth more and amount to at least f.57. But the return freight would be paid for in
heavy money and another advantage to set against it is that, with the English sailing without
convoy, they should be able to get to Stockholm rather carlier if the Dutch ships are not
called for in time.

I am not at all of the opinion that the English will want to go to St Ubes at that price, but
they might be willing to when the winter is nearly over, and to take away their fear of lying
waiting a long time we could stipulate two months for the total loading time at St Ubes and
Stockholm. If the ship going to St Ubes is clear to load up we must write to my
correspondent, N. Simons, who can ensure that he is loaded within 14 days.

The freight-rate between here and St Ubes is less than f.28. I shall now wait to hear from
you at approximately what price it can be expected to be [in England] for my guidance in
case the St Ubes flect has departed from here.

If you have any inclination to have a Dutch ship fetch a load of salt and go to Stockholm,
please let me know. I am thinking of chartering one for myself. Please be quick. I shall leave it
to you to inform me; otherwise I shall keep it to myself for time does not allow one to wait
for an answer.

The answer about the premium on the Coninck David will have to be awaited at leisure,
but please tell them to hurry up the business. I do not think that I ought to bear the interest
whilst the consignment is not credited to me. It is due to you, but it must be found from that
item for I have already paid for it here and so far I have had nothing out of it but trouble. I
long to know what the item will yield.

If the business of Townley is not settled yet, please let me know. I shall then write to Mr T.
so that he can persuade those good people to make an end of it.

My correspondent at Lisbon is Nicholas Simons, consul of His Majesty [the King] of
Sweden. I am sure it will be more advantageous for him to draw bills on us here than on
London, though I do not know what the exchange rate on London is. You should be able to
calculate what the rate was on drafts in the spring. For the English salt ships the exchange on
us here was at 61g [per cruzado].

The insurance rate here on Stockholm is 10 per cent. Our ships, which are due to come
from Stockholm, are taking rather longer than I had expected so I am running a little short.
Thus I trust you will permit me to draw £500 —£600 on you against drafts falling due. If the
effects of mine which you have do not cover it when it falls due I shall make it up some other
way.

Please let Negrinus(3) have another £20 and help him sort things out so that he can be
certain of getting his papers over before the spring.

The letters from Denmark have arrived but bring no further news with them. The
Swedish army draws further offand those at Hamburg write for certain that Malmo has been
relieved and that the Danes are afraid that Sweden might well enter Bleking and besiege

Carelstadt.
Wherewith I remain, &c.

know iron(2) is not so good for returns as hard lemmons, unlesse it can be taken in truck to
advance the pryse of the comditye given for it when it is worth more in the west of England

I have seen what you report in both the one and the other about what is happening to

miracles this year. Because of the great numbers of your ships which have sailed from here,
with more to follow, I can envisage a serious decline in prices. Since you say that the
consignment of iron from Mr Trip is still lying unsold you can correspond with him about it
in Holland. May God soon give us better times by a good peace settlement for the
commonwealth of Christendom, as I said at length in my last.

The twelve bottles and half-dozen knives have reached me but you have forgotten to add

Much salt has now arrived here with the Dutch ships, so it has fallen from 13 dollars to 11 1/2
and 12 and may well fall lower. Since most of it which was sent on account is now gone it
may well improve in the spring. French wine at 150 to 160 dollars per hogshead will also bea

as an honourable man and who holds a privilege from the King that the products
manufactured at the works cannot be seized because of Mommia’s debts but remain at the
disposal of the owners. The conditions of the contract are that one must deliver copper at
Nyköping and three months later one will receive back the same amount of brass-wire,
paying 25 dollars per slb for the cost of manufacture. So far others have had things made on
similar conditions and have been successful, so I am thinking about undertaking it too, even
though it means negotiating with Jacob Reenstierna on the same basis. It will give both me
and my brothers considerable worry to be involved in both works at the same time.

I thought it might be a good idea to suggest to you that you might like to take a half share
in the quantity contracted with Momma’s brother-in-law for one year or longer, if you
thought it advisable. We could then keep it in our hands, for it is a good brand and, according
to the present price of copper, the copper-wire should cost us only about 250 dollars, which
means we ought to be able to have it free on board for 282 or 283 dollars, which should yield a
good pennyworth of profit in view of the advantageous rate of exchange. Please give it
careful consideration and if you should decide to take part I will serve you for a reasonable
commission and the goods belonging to your share will be loaded just as you order. I have not
yet written to my brothers about making this proposal, so you could discuss it with them and convey your decision to me through them, wherewith I remain, &c.","London: 25 dollars per £1 sterling (at 1 months' sight).

three duplicate bills of exchange in question. Mr Bar has since corrected the mistake in the
endorsement. Your letter to our brother David van Baerle at Stockholm was forwarded at
the earliest opportunity, and trust that he will have the opportunity to get 500 rings of 4-band
wire made, but there will be no copper-wire of other brands such as “Three Crowns’ for the
reasons we told you about.

Since your rate of exchange has fallen to 36s 8—7g it is a very good thing that you do not
remit us any more bills, unless it begins to rise again. We are delighted that the ship Paradise
has at last arrived and that the cargo is unloaded.

Since copper-wire is no longer selling as well as it was and now fetches no more than
£6 5s sterling we must simply be patient and hope that things will improve in the spring. We
cannot grant your request for unrestricted freedom to sell ours since we cannot agree to have
it sold for less than £6 5s sterling. And we have no inclination to accept your proposition to
join in chartering ships to go from [England] to St Ubes and from there with a salt cargo to
Stockholm and back again to London at £7 sterling per last. We are so preoccupied with our
old Swedish problems that we have no desire to acquire any new ones. We also consider that
there will not be much profit in it, believing that quite enough salt will be brought there and
that the freights from there to [London] will be very cheap.

We cannot omit to mention to you that our brother David has learned that Francis
Townley obtained insurance on the John & Edward for a premium of only 4 per cent, while
you gave 7 per cent. That is too great a difference, and we would be glad to know how it came about, remaining, &c.","London 36s 4-5g  (2 usances).

As far as I can learn about Swedish wire, there are about 900 to 1.000 coils which have
arrived here by way of Lübeck. They are of various brands such as ‘the Crown’, ‘the Rose’,
‘the Lily’, ‘the Three Crowns’ and also some of the ‘Crowned N’ mark, but how much of
cach and what varieties I cannot quite discover, though as far as I can understand they are
mostly 4-and 5-band. Few of the Swedish wire-sizes have been awaited here but those which
someone has taken sold for 69 ML per 100 lb. and one will hardly get them for less. Swedish
garcopper is at RD 61 per slb, Hamburg wire is at 70 ML per 100 lb., copper kettles at RD 70
and sheet-copper RD 674 per slb. Barbary copper is not sold for cash here but is usually
bartered against sheet-copper and the like, with about RD 20 per slb thrown in according to
how good it is and how well refined. But if you want to know about the sale and demand for
sheet-copper, I think it should not do badly. Please give it careful consideration.

A ship was ready to depart for Bilbao before the winter but has been prevented by the ice. I
believe it will have another opportunity to go as soon as the waters re-open. Yellow Danzig
wax sells for 24 1/4-1/2g, and seems to be in good demand. If you want some of this commodity
please feel free to command me. God knows, I have a thorough knowledge of it and will
endeavour to serve you in this or any other commodity to your greatest advantage.

Thomas Whayman is loading up for Rouen and will hurry off as soon as the waters here
are clear, which will take at least three weeks although it is thawing quickly. William Cutler
is lying here at Dockenhooven! on the Elbe and is all right.

Concerning the Swedish wire: if you would like some I think it would be best if you gave
the order sooner rather than later as it will soon be bought up.

I am glad you found that you agreed with the account I sent and have madea record of it. I
have checked your account of the 10 sacks of cotton and my current account, found them
correct and have noted my agreement.

I shall wait to hear by your next letter if you have obtained the little parcel of Barbary
almonds within my price limits. As you said, plenty are expected and I doubt whether those
who own them will be in a good position. If you cannot obtain them at 37s I do not want
them, and if you have no success with them you would do well to have obtained a good bale
of Ardasse below 9s. Let me know for certain in your next. For your news of what is
happening in one trade or another I am most grateful and beg you to keep me informed of
any pending changes, and also of the departure hither of Barker and Lawson, for my
guidance.

Geer, whom I have long served, has recommended me to you.

I have noted that Captain John Chapman, sailing the ship Tomazine laden with wine from
Bordeaux, has already left Bordeaux and also that Captain John Garret of the ship Concordia,
coming from St Ubes with salt, was ready to depart so that, God willing, they might arrive
here soon and that I should accommodate them with money—to which I say that as soon as
they arrive I shall not only supply them with the required toll-money as well as the ships’
expenses but give them counsel and do as much as possible to assist them. And, if God
permits, I shall at once inform you of their arrival and, in accordance with your request, keep
separate accounts of what I have to pay for the cargo and for the ships’ expenses.

But all English, Scottish or Irish captains who pass the Sound have the liberty (as long as
they are in credit) to pay the un-free Sound toll on their return journey from the Baltic, with
the condition that the merchant to whom they are recommended here must enter into a
pledge to the English Resident that, in the event of the captain not returning (which God
forbid), they will immediately pay the Sound toll themselves. But since you say that I should
pay it, and make no mention of using this English custom [so that nothing need be given here
if the English style is used](1) I shall follow your instructions unless you manage to order me to
use the English right or style before the captains arrive to pass the Sound.
An Englishman has to pay here for his ship’s expenses:

A Dutchman, or whoever he may be, pays altogether as above, with the exception of the
payment to the English Resident. And if any captain arriving at the toll-post to pay for his
licence has no specie rixdollars he has to pay a premium on Danish crowns or cross-rixdollars
of 3s per rixdollar. Before, he used to pay 4s but I have never had to charge my friends’
accounts with more than 4s—that is, 2s per rixdollar. If it should happen that a large fleet of
ships all arrive together and bank-money is in demand, then it could cost 25s per rixdollar,
though that happens rarely. However, the exchange rate at Copenhagen and here usually
differs by 1, or 14 or 2 per cent, because there are few ‘givers’ here but mostly ‘takers’, and as
soon as the captains arrive the money must be immediately ready, and that causes the
difference. Thus one always has to dance to the toll-officers’ pipe, as they well know, and the
captains dare not blink an eye or they will be held up. However, come what may, I shall make
your payments and you may be assured that none of your ships, on safe arrival, will be
neglected for one quarter hour but everything required of me will be done properly. I hope
to conduct myselfin such a way that I shall earn your desire not merely to continue using me
here but to recommend me to others of your friends.

If you also desire me to send you every post-day, or every 8 or 14 days, a notice of the out-
going or in-coming ships, of whatever nationality they may be, and where they may be
going as well as what their cargo consists of, I shall gladly do it. As soon as I know your mind
I will agree with one of the Sound-toll officials about how much I should give him for the
notification of what I request; and since the toll-officials are not allowed to do it, except in
secret, it would be well if it were kept quiet—for your information.

God be praised! We have had open waters here for the last eight or ten days, and five days
ago a Bremen ship, which lay at Copenhagen all winter, came out of the Baltic and passed the
Sound on its way to Bremen. And now, four days ago, two Copenhagen ships which trade to
Spain arrived in the road-stead. They are Jacob Maertens Cloodt of the ship Charlotte Amalie,
mounting 28 guns, as well as Pieter de Verver of Copenhagen, sailing the ship Christiaen
Quintus with 30 guns, both destined for St Ubes and from there to Lisbon. As soon as the wind is favourable they are thinking of setting off, in God’s name. This for your information,

with two of your welcome letters of the 5th and 16th past from which we see that you spoke
to Adam Groenen about the pack which was left lying at the water-side and that he has had it
fetched away so that it can be sent to our brother-in-law Jean Meinss by a well-known
captain as soon as the waters open. We shall look forward to that, thanking you meanwhile
for all the trouble you have taken and also for the information about that well-known person,
and furthermore for all the news and advice about prices and various wares.

At the moment we can find nothing profitable to do because of a lack of sales and because
the rate of exchange remains obstinately high. If it had fallen to about 33s we would have
remitted something for our account so that when it came up for payment we could consider
how best to employ it, but because the exchange has been for some time at 34s 9-10g, and
today is still at 34s 7g at double usance, we have not found it advisable to remit at such a high
price, all the more so as we do not know how to use the money. You advised us to dispose of
our Barbados commodities since their ships are expected by May with an abundance of
goods. We have partly done so, and have sold the sugar, which we had been keeping for so
long, at 6g per lb. Yet it seems we were not wise to do so for it looks as if sugar is going to rise
since it is beginning to be scarce here and in Holland. The stocks in Portugal are also not large,
and those of black ginger have also been bought up. Ten or twelve sacks at a time could
hardly be had for 4 1/2g but are now selling for 4 3/4g, and how it will develop only time will tell.
Campeachy wood remains at 7 3/4 ML per 100 lb.; indigo guatemalo at 6 3/4—7s flem.; fine
caribbean indigo is at 5s flem., and Aleppo galls are at 40 to 41 ML per 100 lb.; pepper is
selling in batches of 10 to 20 sacks at 11 3/4g per lb., and in batches of 3 to 4 sacks is not to be had
for less than 12g. It is a low price. We have a reasonable amount of it by us as we have been
buying it at one time or another while the price got lower and lower in order to offset the
higher-priced stuff, but it has all been at a loss and we dare not order any more. Fine dry wax
sells here at 23 1/2g flem. and fine Turkish Angora yarn is sold by the English here at 7 1/2s flem.
Currants are at 19 to 20 ML per 100 lb. and oil is rather more keenly priced as it is all in strong
hands. Seville and Portuguese oil sells at RD 60 to 62 while Apulian oil is at RD 6s per 820 lb.
Grains are very dull and choice rye can be had for RD 52 per last. A quantity is expected from
Hull and other places, and it is likely to fall to RD 50, if not below, for there seems to be big
supplies. 400 lasts are expected from Magdeburg in three or four days, so some people are
going to lose a lot of money. Buying up almonds is not going to make any great profit.
Ardasse at 9s per lb. of 24 ounces is not too dear. When the exchange was not so adverse we
still had one bale of it lying unsold which you had supplied us with some time ago, but
because it was so coarse people would not have it, which is very annoying. The price here is at
13 to 13 1/4s flem. with 102 per cent discount, which is very low.

Because of this burdensome war, trade is falling away in Germany and everywhere else,
and at the moment we see little prospect of a peace. The river is now open again, however,
and we see that one or two ships from France have arrived off the city, so we must hope that
this will put some life into trade. Please let us know if there is any change at [London] in the
prices of sugars, pepper, ginger, indigo, galls, Ardasse and the like, for which we shall be most
grateful. If we perceive anything profitable and if the exchange begins to be more moderate we shall not neglect to give you some commissions, wherewith our friendliest regards, &c.","London: 34s 7g 2 usances.

opinion that its price will remain steady in Sweden, partly because many works have had to
remain at a standstill through lack of water and have made only a half of what they are
accustomed to produce; and partly because so many English ships have been chartered to go
to St Ubes that there will be a shortage of return ladings.

I have contracted for about 1.500 slb of ‘O’ iron, which I shall keep to myself, so you
cannot expect any to come this summer unless I have about 400-500 slb of the 1.500, which is
lying ready, despatched in the chartered salt ships. The rest will come straight here, and if
your iron prices improve somewhat I can have some ‘G’ iron shipped to you, which the
wholesalers are also familiar with. So, of the two brands, none will get into other hands than
yours, and it will take some time this summer before you are able to sell what you have.

Now, as regards the 'L' iron which, as I mentioned previously, had not yet been
contracted for—I shall not be doing so this time because that brand is not so very well-known
[in England] and because the raw material is not available. It used to be made from one ore,
but as the old mine is now finished and the new one is not so good at first, it may well be a
year before the ore begins to be as good as it was. There is no more of the old ore near the 'L'
works. There is some round about the ‘O’ works which is being mixed with the new ore, and
at the ‘G’ works there is mostly old ore, so that is now turning out best—voila! on nous
enformes pour vos gouverno.

Everyone says that the number of ships going to Stockholm is 18 or 20, and I am sure that
many will not find it worthwhile, particularly if they all arrive at Stockholm together and
have to leave together. We must first see how things go in the spring. Apart from two or
three ships which are now about to arrive from St Ubes, there are so many others that it may
well be September or October before the Dutch ships will be able to arrive, for in April they
first have to go to St Ubes, and I calculate the number going either to the Baltic or here is at
least 50 vessels, which will result in very slow loading.

If Mr Scheurman comes here I shall be able to learn from him how it will affect the
freedom of the ships if they bring wine as well as other goods which are expected every hour.
But of your ships I shall make no mention.

letters of the 9th of September and 23rd of November, from which I see that several of your
letters are missing. Likewise Mr Green has had no letters from you so far and has no idea what
has happened regarding the goods in John Stabler and their insurance, nor what has happened
about those loaded in William Evelyn since you mentioned little about them in your latest
letters. I hope that Evelyn has since arrived and that the goods have found a good market, so
that I can be encouraged to continue trading to England in future.

So far I have got little in stock, because my debtors have not kept their word. The reason is
that, with the present demand for copper-wire, they have obtained from others better
conditions than those they agreed to with me, as a result of which the proposal to have it
manufactured by Willem Momma cannot go ahead since it has been necessary to take the said
Momma to court. In addition, copper has risen to 228 and 238 dollars per slb. Undoubtedly
this will continue as little has been worked. At Norrköping production has only just begun
and at Nyköping only seven forges are working. But the Cronström and Rosenström works
are being driven hard, though most of it is being made by Cronström who has contracted
with Van Cöllen & Uppendorff. And because copper is at a high price abroad the copper-
wire made at Hamburg can hardly be sold for any trifling price.

Because of the continual frost and lack of water that we had in the new year most iron-
works have been ata standstill, so little iron will be produced this spring and iron of ordinary
quality is selling here at 27 to 28 dollars per slb. Setubal salt remains at a low price of 11 1/2 to
12 dollars per last, but as less came in the new year than had been expected its price may get better, wherewith I remain, &c.",,C. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & JACOB DAVID,DUTCH,1677,24 FEBRUARY 1677,3 Apr. 1677,4 Apr. 1677,,352,,

away from home, up-country. I have also been with Jacob Fahlgreen at the Kopperberg and
have tried to be as helpful to him as possible. Mr Fahlgreen is still at the Kopperberg, putting
his affairs in order, but I hope that within a fortnight he will be here again. I will forward your
letter to him by today’s post, without fail, and here inclosed is the letter which Mr Fahlgreen
has written to you. As soon as Mr Fahlgreen returns here he will take the first opportunity of
returning to London.

Since my last letter I have safely received from London your welcome letters of
November 10th and 23rd, December 29th and January 16th, to which this will serve as a
reply. Isee that trade in iron has been going badly. Iron prices here are high at 28 to 29 dollars.
During the winter I bought about 3.000 slb of 3-inch iron and t-inch square iron which I am
expecting here from the works as soon as the rivers are open. May God bring them safely. I
shall sell it all here. But I have also bought 300 slb of garcopper during the winter which I am
having made mostly into wire, but—God willing —I shall send you a quantity and I shall
send it in your name. But the English Resident here has to give the captains a note or
certificate that the ship and the goods are English and that the merchant is truly English, so
everyone must declare on demand that the goods in the ship are strictly English. If you could
write to the Resident to give me a certificate that the goods I have loaded are for your
account, as is everything I have loaded, then the Resident is likely to help me. As you are
getting 2 per cent you could well declare them to be your own and answer for them. Besides,
I shall also be ordering all kinds of English merchandise, such as all sorts of cloth serges and
bays, and as soon as I know that you have got me free to leave Stockholm waters I shall be
wanting something from you. However, I intend to pay freight and duties here myselfat the
rate of 12 per cent though, as you know, I could put it under our Swedish names if I have to
make use of other friends. I await your answer to this.

I see that Capt. Nicolas Payton has arrived safely at Harwich, God be praised! I hope he
will soon reach London and deliver the 350 coils of brass-wire which he has for you. I trust
you will do your best for me. I am in no great hurry for the money and only want you to seek
the highest possible price. I also expect at the earliest opportunity an account of the 1.280 coils
whose proceeds, I see, amount to £1.666. I had expected £100 more. I hope that the
RD 6.751 23s Dutch current-money has been remitted to our friends in Amsterdam,
although I dearly wish it had been remitted net, as I ordered, for I have ascribed it to our friend that way in my books. This is all by way of reply; may God bless you, &c.

you have been pleased to honour me and to communicate what is happening with regard to
trade in [England]. I must admit that I have been somewhat negligent about answering them
in good time, but I would have been prompter if I had been fortunate enough to find any
advantage which we could extract from our correspondence. However, the scarcity of
opportunities and the fact that prices are falling nearly every day and also that those in
[England] are closely related to those here means that one can hardly earn any profit. Even if
one imports something carefully, without extra-ordinary costs, one can casily suffer loss if the
least thing happens. So I have been unable to make any ventures in getting anything bought
in [England] and trade with Sweden is at present so depressed that our friends cannot export
anything, and there is nothing specially worth doing in that area because the high freights
which one must pay to English skippers eats up the profit, and as a result commissions from
those regions are declining greatly.

However I am extremely grateful to you for your good advice and your willingness to be
of service, to which you will always find me equally willing to perform anything you may
care to command.

In the last eight days grains have risen at least 20 to 25 per cent because of strong demand
from Brabant. Such large amounts are no longer coming from England, and if the imports
from [England] should cease there is likely to be a major rise, but most people are of the
opinion that the high market price will bring plenty from [England]. The exchange on
Hamburg has fallen to 33;4 but this increase in grain prices will raise it again.

The East India Company has sold its Molucca wares and they have all been very dear—
cloves at 74 to 76 stuivers [per lb.], nutmegs 44 to 50 stuivers [per lb.] mace 16s to 18s [per lb.]

when he arrived at Setubal (God be praised) together with six others from [England] four or
five days ago. The order to let him have a suitable cargo of Setubal salt was also received and
will be performed according to instructions. As regards the good measure and quality of the
salt, together with the promptness of its despatch, you may rest assured that no one will be
more advantageously dealt with, but the fourteen days allowed for loading are too short for
any satisfactory despatch, for it must necessarily take a month, and even if one could get it
clear in less than a month one would have to wait for his accompanying ships, which will
need to have at least four or five weeks. Please bear in mind in future that it is no use limiting
the captain to twelve or fourteen days, more or less, if it states in the charter-party that he is to
leave in company with others. Furthermore, I am quite sure that I can give better despatch
and as much speed as anyone if he is loaded in a more leisurely way, which also permits one
further advantage in the measurement of the salt.

The price of the salt and the accompanying costs are always agreed at Setubal and there has
been no change in them for the last fourteen or fifteen years. However, during times when
there are 50 or 60 ships together loading, they sometimes have to remain lying there for eight
or ten weeks; and it sometimes happens that when the opportunity arises to join suitable,
good company which would allow some of the ships to depart, or they decide to join a
foreign convoy, they will spend £50 or £60 for the benefit of speedy despatch. But the same
haste often occasions great prejudice in the measure and quality of the salt. Otherwise, as I
said above, the charges and the price of the salt are always agreed. Here at Lisbon the price
follows the market, though it is usually cheaper than at Setubal where the measure and
quality of the salt is more advantageous and better than that here—for your advice.

I had news from Mons. Steven de Geer at least three or four weeks ago that you had
chartered the above-mentioned ship, and probably yet more. On their arrival your orders
will be punctually followed, but there seldom occurs any opportunity to draw bills on
[London] which has to be done on Amsterdam where the rate of exchange is also more
favourable. At present it is at 62 to 62 1/2g [flem. per cruzado]. Whether the total costs of the
above-mentioned ship are drawn on De Geer (as he instructed) though by way of [London]
or Amsterdam, it will always be by the most favourable rate, the success of which you will
learn in due course.

Since Swedish shipping has been prevented from coming here by this dreadful war there is
a great shortage here of all Swedish wares. Iron could at present fetch between 3.000 and
3,200 reis per quintal of 128 lb. A Swedish shippound counts for about 294 lb. here, and on
each quintal falls about 450 reis duty and charges. Deals, according to size and quality, are 30
to 40 to 45 crowns(1) per 122 pieces; beams are likewise (according to quality) 500 to 1,500 and
2,000 reis per piece. Masts of 15 to 24 palms are, one with another, 70,000 reis per piece. Tar,
3,000 reis per tun—free on duty and charges since the purchaser usually pays these. Only with
iron is it customary for the owner to pay the duty and expenses—for your guidance.

I take the liberty of troubling you further with a bill of exchange for £88 12s sterling at
8 days sight drawn on Johan Crogher, value of myself though stated pro forma from Pieter
Meyer, arising from an assignment which the said Crogher received from Sam. Sowton
drawn on one, Thomas Thussen, iron dealer in [London] in payment of a bill of exchange
passed for my account on the said Sowton. Now a year and a day has passed during which the
said Crogher has kept me waiting, notwithstanding that I have written to him several times
and exhorted him through a friend in Amsterdam but he never answered a single letter, only
writing occasionally a note to the friend in Amsterdam and putting him off with fair
promises. At last he wrote to my friend on the 12th/22nd of December last year, informing
him that he had received the proceeds of the assignment from Thussen and that he would
remit the total to me through his brother, Captain William Crogher, at a rate of exchange of
6s 7—8d per mil reis, together with other small details, for which I have been waiting. Now his
brother has arrived at Setubal with these latest ships from [England], but with no letter, no
news, much less any remittance from Crogher, which is very un-mannerly. I beg you to
obtain friendly satisfaction for the aforesaid bill of exchange and after deducting something
for commission and similar small expenses remit the remainder to me here so that I can at
least get something. The enclosed letter to him is going open, which you may close at
pleasure, forgiving me for troubling you with such small matters. I remain, always ready and
willing to serve you in anything you may be pleased to command as De Geer is so close a friend, yours &c.

notwithstanding that these folk are adequate enough.

Regarding the ship with wine, as soon as it arrives I shall do my best to take care of it and
follow all your orders and communicate with your agent. I had thought that one would be
able to get this cargo in as Swedish, duty-free, but I have now received news that this cannot
be, because this year no goods or ships will enjoy Swedish duty-freedom. If this should be the
case for the ships bringing salt it will fall very heavily on the goods coming in and going out
on the Thomazine, as it makes a difference of one-third in the duty. I now hope that a further
order will come asa decision about it has been deferred by the King. It is to be feared that the
ship will arrive at just the moment when there will be an embargo on all shipping since it
appears that our war-flect will be in the Daalders(2) at about that time. If such is the case, and if
one cannot enjoy the full freedom from duties, I do not think it will be advisable to load this
ship for your account, because even if the first eventuality does not occur it will be burdened
with the high duty, and it would be better if your returns were loaded in the salt-ship as long
as the increase in the toll is in prospect. However, I shall always act for your greatest
advantage as circumstances offer and as soon as the Concordia has arrived I shall take good care
that it is fully laden by others. Mr Boor will also have a consignment to load. I shall do my
best to sell the wine for cash as far as possible, but so far as I can learn from others these goods
are not often sold wholesale for cash. Now that the returns need not be held up I shall be able
to go to Stockholm immediately at the end of the month, so your agent can meanwhile prepare everything. Wherewith regards, &c.",,C. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & JACOB DAVID,DUTCH,1677,5 APRIL 1677,12 May 1677,18 May 1677,,627,,

of the 1.650 coils of copper-wire received by you from the ship John & Edward, captain John
Stabler, of which you state the net proceeds to amount to £2.203 sterling. We have checked
it and find that the customs, scavage, passport and town duties amount to a great deal and are
much above our estimate. Madame your wife and Mr Peter Joye, in the year 1672, when we
sent them 400 coils from here, only brought £32 16s into the account for customs, scavage,
passport and town duties, but for these 1.650 coils you put down £167 5s, which differs
considerably. Please check it again and if you find a mistake please correct it, as well as
deducting the extra 4 per cent commission which you have incorrectly put down. Our
brother David wrote to us that he had agreed with you that you would only charge 14 per
cent in the account for the brass consigned to you by John Green. Otherwise we have found
no error in the account, which we are returning herewith so that you can correct it and
interline what has been omitted.

We see that, instead of having any money for us in cash, you are actually out of pocket.
The exchange is now too low for discounting any bill. However, we thank you for your offer
to continue serving us in the disposal of our remaining copper-wire before the arrival of new
wire from Sweden. It is welcome, but if it cannot be arranged and other people begin to
undercut our prices for that commodity you will please not follow them too closely as we are
not willing to have ours sold for less than £6 5s, for your guidance.

2 John Sheppard.","The copy of your letter dated the 26th of September I answered on the 11th of December.
Since then I have received the original, and that of the 10th and 23rd of November as well as
those of the 22nd of December and 16th of January, most of them all at the same time. I have
also the account which you sent with them, and the letter of the 23rd of November which
you said was sent via your servant. It was delivered by Mr Klitzert,(1) and from your servant I
have heard nothing. And I understand from your letters that none of mine have come to your
hands which I wrote on the 24th of August, the 5th of October, the 16th of October (under
cover of Mr Klitzert) and the last of 11th of December under cover of Mr Perman (as I
supposed). I am astonished that you should have received none of them.

Coming now to reply, I must say that I have partly checked your account and find that
you have left out RD 2.000, which you paid long ago to Mr De Geer, which was properly
entered into my books in conformity with your letters, and entered it shall remain. If you
find yourself falling short on other items they ought not to have been sold in that manner. I
can also not approve of the bad debts, for you wrote nothing to me about them between 1672
and 1675, although the account was settled annually. The last time you sold anything to John
Skepper(2) was in 1672 and it was over a year before anything was paid, when you credited
him with £53 7s 4din 1673. Now I happen to know that others sold to him in 1674 and have
been paid, and it was not until 1675 that he absconded, in which time one could have easily
demanded the debt. I corresponded for a long time with your predecessors, Jan de Buck and
Marescoe, and before that with their employer, Mr Jacques Bove, but I have never
encountered anything like this in these unseasonable times. You have also reckoned all the
interest on the debts at 6 per cent though you know it should be only 5 per cent. I know
perfectly well that you should not have to carry bad debts, but I know even better that one
ought not to be kept in suspense but be informed in a business-like style, annually on the
closing of accounts, of any outstanding debts—of which, during four years, I was told
nothing. So please understand that I shall not close this account until everything is sold and
the final total agreed. Then we can reckon the interest as it ought to be, so please make an end
of the sale as soon as possible.

I was greatly misled when I was told in writing that one could sell 400 slb per annum of
black kettles, or the like, and thus to send so many pots to England which you were to sell to
the Guinea Company or to Spanish or Muscovy merchants. It is a good product, and what I
have had manufactured recently I have been selling at Stockholm to the Russians and get
more for them than I would abroad. You will please make an end of them and not quibble
too much about the price, but do not sell to people who are unreliable about paying, as
Skeppart was. I would not be insisting on this if you had kept your fine words to have a
watchful eye, as you could and ought to have had over the last three or four years.

It is unnecessary to write any more, as you can be better informed from your correspondents at Stockholm about the way trade is. At this place there is nothing to be done,
and I commend you, with regards, &c.

saying that he had arrived there safely on the 25th of November last year. And as he has had
the honour of being consulted by you regarding trade he has requested us to give you advice
about what is happening to it here. Thus we take this opportunity of free postage by the
departure of six French ships (two for Leghorn and four for Marseille) to trouble you with
our notes about the goods which are called for here from [England], as well as about those
which are sent from here to [England]. In addition we describe some assortments of Dutch
linens, perpetuanas and calculations about linens with 28 stuiver coins and also Dutch steel.
From these you will be able to see what you may profitably turn to account. If you should be
inclined to make a trial of one thing or another we beg that we may be favoured. You may be
assured that you will be so well satisfied that you will want to continue.

Firstly, the principal goods brought here from [England] are ‘Londons’ —of three sorts, each
selling according to its quality, which are called perpetuanas—lead, and iron wire as well as
other goods which you can see from the enclosed note. The goods which [England] most
demands from here are silks (Ardasse, Legis or Serbassi) Angora or Beybesar yarn, cotton wool
and cotton yarn, gall-nuts, testick-wax,(1) or hoeden wol, aniseed and [—blank—].

Secondly, the goods from Holland on which a good penny-worth can be gained are the
smallest cloths, Danzig-steel, brown gum-lack, stockings of grey ‘bont-werk’,(2) and (above all)
most preferred are Dutch textiles which one must exchange against Turkish yarn from
Angora or Beybesar and against cotton-wool, gall-nuts, aniseed, testick, mastic, palm-wood
and wax; also against silk (Ardasse, Legi and Serbassi). In bartering for [silk] one must always
provide half the value in money, and for all other goods one-third in cash, so that the costs of
freight, consular charges and other sorts of outgoing and incoming goods can be paid for.
The most useful and profitable specie are Lion dollars which are currently being struck in
[England] and sent here in large quantities, together with 22-, 26- and 28-stuiver coins out of
Holland, which are packed in between the cloths. One can make a good profit on these coins,
as well as on Danzig-steel which can be got in Holland for f.10 or f.11 per hundred pounds,
free on board. The latter is presently selling here for LD 8 1/4 per cantar(3) and is sometimes at
LD 10 or LD 11 according to the amount in town. Gum-lack is LD 1 1/4 per oque,(4) grey bont-
werk stockings are LD 6 1/2 to 7 per hundred, first-quality cotton-wool LD 7 and second-
quality LD 5 3/4 per cantar.

For further news of what is happening in the course of trade please look at the
accompanying price-current, and—as we have said—if you are disposed to see some
advantage in making a trial we beg that we may have the honour. You will have satisfaction
and enjoy quick returns, as time will tell.

Six days ago we reccived letters from a friend saying that the great Sultan had publicly
entered Constantinople in unusual pomp together with his mother and the Grand Vizier.(5)
Nobody here had believed it would happen. And as the great man is now trying to keep his
head he has demanded the head of his brother, but since his mother is very protective of him
no one knows how it will turn out. Two days after the said great lord entered Constantinople
he forbade any women to be scen on the streets any more and one afternoon, sitting in his
seraglio by the sea-side he saw sailing by some vessels with women, which ran aground. He
had the poor women drowned. If things go on like this one must wonder what is coming
next.

For the last five days there has been seen here, for three hours every midnight, a comet-star
rising in the north-east among the stars on high. It is about an ell long and hovers a little
towards the due-north. What this may signify the good Lord alone knows, to whom I pray

thing or another mentioned in the copy. You will be fully satisfied and receive quick returns.

On the 24th last the ship Providence arrived here from [England] after 62 days, bringing
with it nothing else but 900 ‘loaves’ of lead and brazil-wood, as a result of which the first has
fallen to LD 4 7/8 per cantar. Three [Levant] Company ships arc in lading for England and are to
leave in three of four weeks. In their company there will also be another English ship, the
Europa (which lately arrived) going addritura to Holland. It has a good freight and you will
get a note of its cargo, as well as that of the three Company ships when they depart. On the
29th past two English ships, the Son Joseph and Catiador, arrived from Leghorn after 30 days,
without any cargoes, and on the Ist instant two French ships arrived from Marseille after 50
days, together with a Venetian ship, the Servio from Venice. On the 2nd an English ship, the
Benjamin & Elizabeth, arrived from Genoa and Leghorn, loaded with goods from Holland
consisting of about 600 cloths, besides other goods. There was also a ragoute(6) from Venice.
With all these ships we have had no special news exept that a convoy of four merchant ships
were on the point of departing to come here from Holland under the protection of 30
warships as far as Sicily, from where they will be convoyed here with a considerable fleet.

Since then I have only just
received, yesterday, yours of the 12th of April from which I see what you have to say about
the copper coins. As it is now forbidden to export them I can send no great quantity.
Nevertheless I have ordered them to send you some from Gothenburg and will write in the
morning (God willing) that they are not to send you more than 4 or 5 tuns. However, I
remain of the opinion that this commodity must rise and hold its price since no garcopper of
any importance can be sent from here as long as one has to pay the un-free duty—which
means that not one shippound of garcopper can go from here for less than 450 dollars—
which, reckoning the £1 sterling at 25 dollars, means £18. Now, as soon as you receive it
from Gothenburg I shall be glad to learn at once what can be done with it. At present wire
costs 290 dollars per shippound; iron is at 30 to 32 dollars, which are good prices, and voyage
iron is 33 dollars, so I do not think that one can send any iron to [England] if one wants to
recover the money invested. Things are very bad here with regard to freedom from duties.
Whoever brings in no salt, ammunition or ordinary woven cloth must pay the un-free duty,
which makes a difference of at least 3 RD on a shippound of wire. Consequently business is
quite extraordinary here at present.

Your 2.000 coils of wire will have been sold long ago. If not, you should sell them at once
as 3.000 coils are going from here to [England]. So far, little has gone for Lübeck, Hamburg,
France or Holland, but I shall be sending some to these places in order not to spoil the market
in [England]. It will be explained to you more fully in our next letters that Mr Van Cöllen
and I have separated and that from now on you are to accept nothing for our partnership
unless it is signed by us both in our own writing. Please bear this in mind.

With regard to anything I may send you (which could be considered as sold, free-on-
board, when it is delivered) I shall draw nothing on you before the ship leaves the Daalders.

Danish naval success that month left honours even and ensured a prolongation of the war.","I find I have your letter of the 17th past. It is astonishing how things are going in Sweden with
regard to the purchase of iron, the English buying everything that appears for 30 dollars per
shippound. My brother has sold 3.000 to 4.000 slb of his 'L' on commission for that much
and Boor has also sold some of my ‘O’ and others besides similarly. There were so many ships
there that they did not know how to get any London-bound cargoes for £2 or £2 1/2. I would
guess that when these ships arrive in London there will be not a little undercutting in iron
prices, so I think it would be most advisable if you sold what you have of mine before the
ships arrive and iron gets into too many hands. As for pan-iron we must look into it. There
will be little or nothing coming this year so it should eventually find its buyers, but we must
let it lie for a while and be patient.

It is now too late to have 13- and 13-inch iron made. If only I had had your letter earlier,
there were 300 slb lying at Stockholm which have now been shipped to [blank].

I shall now be getting some letters from Sweden which I am sure will yield a bad account
unless Cletcher has bought tar for you in good time, for I am afraid there has been too much
in the country.
Mr Botte tells me that he has acquired for himself all the tar that goes to London, and that
he has consigned it all to you so that it remains in few hands.

Let me know if you have anything concerning the wine lading. I see from Boor’s letters
that Cletcher has sold the salt for less than 10} dollars. That is too low. Boor has also sold some for me but I think he would have done well to leave it. There is plenty there but
nevertheless the price is too low, wherewith I remain, &c.

to sell immediately, cost what it may. It is beyond reason but in these latest letters I have been
informed that the English are now buying iron for 30 dollars which was last year selling at
25 dollars, while the salt which was sold last year at 12 dollars is now selling at 10 1/2. You can
well conceive what a difference that makes. One should be able to say that, because it was
bought up at such a high cost, the price of iron must rise. In other places they would hold on
to it, but not the English! They must sell, cost what it may, so once again I beg you and order
you to sell my iron at the market price, for large amounts will be coming from Sweden.",,C. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & JACOB DAVID,DUTCH,1677,6 AUGUST 1677,6 Aug. 1677,7 Aug. 1677,,222,,

letters of the 18th and 25th of May as well as of the 19th and 3rd of July, and yesterday I
received yours of the 27th of July in which I find the answer to mine of the 16th/26th past
from Hamburg.

I perfectly understand your feelings about the consignment of pitch and tar, as well as your
argument about selling and marketing.(1) I am also grateful for the conditions you have
offered. I have already let you have my views about these matters and if you are willing to
undertake the business for me in [England] on the following terms we can try each other out
for this year, and if I am satisfied (which I do not doubt) I shall be glad to continue with you,
vizt.:

1. In accordance with your request, the goods will be sent to [London] with the exception of
80 lasts of pitch and 100 lasts of tar, which will be ordered for Hull as you asked.

2. On their arrival you will do your best to sell them from the ships according to the prices
which] shall, from time to time, recommend and if these prices cannot be obtained the goods
are to be stored in a good and convenient warehouse until such time as an opportunity offers,
for which one ought not to be in too great a hurry as these quantities are not large.
Furthermore, it means I can sell as I choose, and as the prices here are £22— £22 1/2 flem. for tar
(which, with discount and rebate amounts to f.120 net) my present advice would be that the
consignment sent aboard Robert Young and due to arrive soon should not be sold below Lu
sterling for the tar and £15 sterling for the pitch. It should be sold at 3 months time precisely,
so that the bills of exchange can be paid; and in order that I may sleep all the sounder I would
ask you to stand liable for debts, which you are better able to settle than anyone, having
knowledge enough about your customers not to give credit to anyone other than reliable
people.

If you do so I shall:

3. allow you 2 per cent commission, and for interest (according to your demand) 4 per cent
per month for your outlay on freight charges and bills of exchange. Further:

4. I have agreed not to draw on you more than £5 per last on the tar and £7 per last on the
pitch from the time the goods arrive until the time when they are sold, when you will always
allow me to dispose of the balance in such a way that what remains unsold from time to time
is only charged with £5 per last of tar and £7 per last of pitch, including all expenses.

I have no doubt that these conditions will please you and that you will consent to them,
handling the costs as if they were your own, on which I shall rely and await your decision by
 your next letter. Wherewith I remain, &c.","London: 36s 1-1 1/2g 2usances.

decline than a rise in indigo prices at present since large amounts have arrived with the East

also so in the region of Nantes in France, but that it is abundant in England and that large
amounts have been contracted for in Spain. I shall be glad to know what truth there is in this,
and how much a last of wheat will cost in [England], free on board. Fish and grain from
[England] are probably in some demand in Spain. Exactly what demand there is I do not

your news of what is happening with regard to the pitch and tar trade in England. Thank you
for the information, and since Mr Botte has contracted to undertake the business and has
instructed me to arrange the shipments to you, I have consigned to you the following (which
will be followed quickly by the bills of lading)—in Captain Robert Young, 62 lasts of tar
at 13 barrels per last (consisting of 47 1/6 lasts of Stockholm tar and 20 lasts of Viborg tar at
12 barrels per last) and 20 lasts of pitch at 12 barrels per last; likewise with John Chapman
23 1/13 lasts of tar and 5 10/13 lasts of pitch at 13 barrels per last; likewise in Henry Sutton 28 8/13 lasts
of tar and 6 6/13 lasts of pitch. John Garret and Francis Benson are still lying in lading and
when they have their full cargoes I shall send you news of it. More will follow shortly so I
hope you will be able to have the required amount. Since Mr Botte already set sail a fortnight
ago on his journey to Amsterdam by way of Lübeck I hope he has arrived long before you see
this and has corresponded with you about what is necessary for this business.

It is true that in Kalmar and Vastervik one can obtain no more tar for any money, and
from Gothenburg, Halmstad and Viborg no more is expected.

Thank you for offering your services to me, I shall bear that prospect in mind when the
dear Lord grants us peace. Because of these troubled times we citizens have had all our
business taken away and have had to leave it all to foreigners while we patiently wait for
better times, which the dear Lord may soon grant.

Because there is little iron in stock here the price is high, and the recent severe winter and
great thaw have restricted many works, which are remaining at a standstill, to which the
floods of the spring and the subsequent great drought have contributed not a little. So far this
year Holland has not ordered much iron and most of it has been sold to Englishmen resident
here.

the difference between the 4 per cent given by Francis Townley and the 7 per cent given by
you on the same ship and at about the same time is too great. It would be a big enough
difference if one granted an extra 1 per cent for the reliability of the insurers but in addition
you put down another 1 per cent for the clause that, in the event of loss, payment would be
made without deduction, and on checking through your earlier letters I find that in one of the
16th of June 1676 you wrote that such a clause made a difference of only 1/4 per cent; and that
still leaves another 1 per cent which you cannot explain.

I beg you to believe that brass-ware is a commodity which needs to be handled with skill. I
cannot commend anyone who is neglectful about arranging insurance but to give it away in
haste and to have no regard to what an insurer puts is also not commendable and takes away a
large part of the profit.

I hope you have done your duty in selling and have made some recompense by selling at a
good price. Brass-wire remains at about 270 dollars per shippound, garcopper at 226 to 227 dollars, ordinary fine iron at 28 to 29 dollars and St Ubes salt at 12 dollars per ton. With

2 Samuel van Breda, of Stockholm and Amsterdam.","I refer myself to my last letter of the 3 1st past. Since then I have been at The Hague for a while
concerning business affairs and on coming home found your letters of the 24th, 28th and 31st
ditto, in answer to which I cannot agree to sell any tar for less than £10 10s sterling, be it at
Harwich or at London, and if our friends will not agree to that please store what belongs to
me. They can sulk, and they can receive what is due to them if they need it and thus be able
to pay up all the more promptly. And I am not obliged to follow them because of any
disputed points about which they make claims, as set out in your last letter of the 31st of
August. For although I have been assured by the Directors in the contract settled on the 3rd of
April this year that for a period of two years they would not sell tar for England to anyone
but me, our friends cannot guarantee that no Viborg or Stockholm tar besides mine will
arrive, firstly because it could be stolen and secondly because malicious people here or at
Lübeck could buy up assortments and have them sent to [England] in order to make claims,
for which I have no desire. So, as I have said before, it is best to sell, which I urge you to do.

If you cannot arrange any freight charters for Stockholm at £3 sterling per last you do not
need to go to any further trouble. I shall wait until next year, and it is much better that one
does not get too much this year in view of the quantities which have arrived from Vastervik
and are yet expected,

Thank you for mentioning the idea of chartering salt ships for St Ubes next year. I shall
think about it and may well decide to charter a consignment if it can be obtained at £5
sterling —i.e. from St Ubes to Stockholm and from there to [London] at eighteen tuns of salt
per last and a similar lading in return. Let me know more in due course.

In your letter of the 28th of August I have found the account for the cargo in Captain
Robert Young, consisting of 62 lasts of tar and 20 lasts of pitch, which you have forgotten to
sign. Please get it right in future. I have checked it and find that you have charged me £5 8s
for brokerage, short-change and false money at 3 per cent, which according to my contention
ought not to be charged to me as it is not the practice here and is covered by your
commission. For if one has regular tar customers one does not need to deal with brokers, and
if a cashier receives false money he ought to pay for it, for what he does not see with his eyes
he ought to feel in his purse. So I expect you to reimburse me for this item. Secondly, while
you have rebated two months from the total proceeds (so that the goods have only yielded
1 per cent) you have additionally charged me four months interest on expenses totalling
£216 95, which is also a mistake. For if you have reckoned the full rate of interest on this
£216 9s so much the less ought you to rebate for two months. There is also a mistake of
£2 35 3d which you will please credit to me. Apart from this I find your account correct.

You were pleased to tell me that you have written to Mr Cletcher at Stockholm that the
tar and pitch loaded in the Thomasina were absolutely for your account. Now you may
remember that you have promised me before to tell no one for whose account these goods
were going, so I have said nothing to Mr Cletcher nor anyone else at [Stockholm]. I beg you
always to keep it secret, for one does not need to give anyone unnecessary information.

Regarding the hire of a warehouse, I rely on you to arrange it as carefully as possible.

I am glad that, following my instructions, you will not sell the tar for less than £10 10s. I
shall rely on that, and am in agreement with you onall the conditions so far as concerns debts.
Since you write that there are only four or five [customers] that one can trust I beg you to let
me know their names so that I can inform myself about them. I am very apprehensive about
this because I have had my fingers burnt before and if you could remove my uneasiness on
this score I cannot see anything to sever our correspondence provided that you follow my
instructions in selling. I beg you to give it further thought and let me know your good ideas. I
can assure you that if we once get our relationship settled on a firm foundation you will be
able to earn with me a handsome commission.

Please do not forget to send the Canary sack to Stockholm at the earliest opportunity,
addressing it to Claes Wilkens, and if you are able to charter some ships, as you said, please
address them to Wilkens and to Burghermaster Hans Smitt at Viborg.

I shall not neglect to recommend you to my friends, but it will not be necessary to do so for
Breda(2) because if I had not had his previous recommendation I would not be corresponding
with you now.

When the opportunity occurs I beg you to send me sixty bottles of good Canary sack, and
make a note of it on my account.

what is to bee mended I will loose noe time to imploy my outmost power for to doc it. It may
bee that some frinds have seen mee here that went for England, but truly I did not know so
much, for I did write per Gottenborgh which I thought was the securest way and
recomended my letters to Mr Robert Clarck that hee should send them away with the very
first opportunity of frinds and ships. If Mr Clarck have not observed my orders but letten the
letters ly hee is much to bee blamed, for hee aught att least let mee know so much that I might
have governe mee there after. Yesterday I did write to him for to know what he has done
with my letters.

Toward the beginning of September, please God, shall I live in Gottenborgh for to goe for
England if I don’t get contrary orders from you before, and about that time doe I expect those
goods I have written for. As soon as the ship Concord is departed this port I doe intend for to
goe up in the country for 2 weekes for to settel my affairs in as good a order as I can before I
returne for England. By this inclosed letter of Mr Cletcher you shall understand what her
loading is. You will also have the account of the salt, the neet amounting to 16.143 dollars 6

give mee order for to make up the account with the master, which I also have done, and has
given meea recept for 1.595 dollars copper monys, where of hee has payd all the port charges,
The recept I am orderd to send to Mr Cletcher with the first post. The master has in for your

have bought you some good birtch wood but here is non to bee had for mony. However, I
have given order to the master thatt in case hee meets any boats with good wood that hee
shall buy you 4 or 6 fadoms and stow it up from the tarr. The wind has been very good this 8

Thus, according to our agreement, I can still draw £600 on you, at interest, until the goods
are sold. It therefore seems rather strange to me that you should forbid me to draw any more
without your consent. If I had been able to get out from Stockholm all the goods for which I
have paid, you would find that I should not have to draw to the utter limit, but now—for
lack of more than 300 lasts still lying in Sweden, for which I have paid—I have to make those
goods which have arrived as serviceable as I can. I hope you will be kind enough not to insist
too strictly on what was promised and not object to an extra £400, for no business of any
importance would be done if one were so narrowly watched that one was always afraid of
running short. I hope that, in view of what you still have in your hands, and other things, you
will not feel uneasy about me. Thus, I have drawn two more bills of exchange, sent herewith,
payable at double usance to the orders of Joseph Deutz,
vizt. £600 at 2 usances

£400 at 2 usances, which I beg you to return accepted by the next post. If, by the time
they fall due, you are unable to sell enough of what remains still unsold to cover the balance in
excess of the £5 and £7 plus expenses, I give you my permission to draw on me what is
lacking and I shall accept your drafts.

The quantity which remains unsold is not of much consequence, and if the customers will
not buy it directly from the ships, so that one has to incur expenses, please hold the price of tar
at £11 and the pitch at £15 sterling.

I should be glad to see you arrange the charter for St Ubes at the price, and on the

cannot neglect to inform you that Jeremias van Raey, a substantial merchant here, has gone
bankrupt. I hope you are not implicated, which I shall be relieved to hear. Let this serve as a
warning against any further involvement. I am not involved, but more through good luck
than judgement. It is indeed lamentable that such a pillar should come to fall, but what can
one say? We live in very miserable times. There have been two or three other small bank-
ruptcies not long ago and as a result one does not know whom one can trust. On the
Exchange credit is entirely dead and one may shortly hear of further failures, so if the Lord is
not merciful to us in granting a good peace many honourable folk will be ruined by this
lengthy and disastrous war. One hears of nothing but losses, and business is so bad that one has
to run great risks at sea from capers and other dangers. Instead of profits, commodities are
frequently yielding losses, for in general business has been ruined and most kinds of
merchandize are at such low prices that it is astonishing. Nothing is selling because demand is
very poor. The whole of Christendom is troubled and the war has impoverished so many
people that wares simply do not sell. There are many folk who, inspired by the low price of
various goods, sent large amounts here in recent years in hopes of a peace and a rise in prices,
but they have been greatly deceived in their expectations. The older the goods the more they
are slighted. Capital is in confusion(1) and we can see no sign of any improvement—enfin, it is
better to sit tight than to invest, and that is the reason why I dare undertake little, for if one
balances the risk against the small prospect of profit neither the one nor the other is
encouraging. May the Lord drive away these dark clouds and give us a long and durable
peace!

The burghermasters have allowed Van Raey a free pass so that no one can molest him fora
given time, on the grounds that his business is not in such a bad way but has been overtaken by bills of exchange and some goods have been delayed here and there. The Lord will settle
everything for the best, to whose protection I commend you and, offering my services,

see that you have not yet bought the 10 sacks of Smyrna cotton which I ordered because of a
lack of ships coming this way. The Elbe here has been full of ice but is now navigable again
and there are two ships which have arrived here from [England], and since you said that you
were arranging for a ship to come here I assume you have performed my commission and
await the account and the bill of lading.

I shall maintain the price of your remaining cotton at 14g, for it ought to fetch as muchas it
costs in [England], but because it is now an unfavourable time of year one ought to take that
into consideration a little and wait until there is further demand. I have sold nothing of our
Ardasse yet. I am holding it at 15s and it would have sold readily if Persian had not arrived
here who brought a good quantity overland through Poland and ruined the market. One
must have patience. As I told you, ours are too coarse and stringy. In future, obtain
something better, I shall regulate myself according to the way things go in [England] and if I
discover anything good or likely to succeed will let you know.

I am glad that Mr Martens Ecking has taken the £20 remitted and placed it to my account.
It can serve towards the commissioned cotton. With this letter I am remitting you for that
account £50 at double usance on John Banks negotiated here with Jan & Herman Luys at
34s 4g. Please procure what is necessary for the enclosed first copy of the bill of exchange and
credit my account with £85 16s 8d.

I was glad to hear that you are not involved in the recent bankruptcy here and hope you
are likewise free of those which have since followed, as I am, God be thanked! May He
protect us from wicked men. I shall be glad to hear more of what is to be hoped for from
[England] regarding peace and war, and also if there are any changes in commodities taking
place. There is little worth mentioning here, partly because of the many bankruptcies and
scarcity of money. Apulian oil costs RD 92 per 820 lb. for cash; currants are 30 to 31 ML per
100 lb. with 8} per cent rebate, since a quantity has arrived here from [England]. Barbary
almonds are at 32 ML per 100 lb., Aleppo galls at 45 to 48 ML, brown ginger 44 to 42 g per
lb., and scraped ginger at 9 or 93g with 83 per cent rebate. Of Swedish copper-wire there are
only about 250 coils here. Most of it is ‘Great Crown’ and the residue ‘Crowned N’ and it
cannot be had for less than 70 to 693 ML per 100 lb. Hamburg copper-wire is at 71 to 72 ML,
while copper kettles are at RD 70, sheet copper at RD 68 to 69, Swedish garcopper RD 644 to
65 and Hungarian plates RD 60 to 61 per shippound. If there is anything in which I can be of
service please inform me and command.

B. Sirps has been here and as far as I understand has not yet returned to [England]. If he
arrives in [London] you will know how to demand the letter-postage from him, as already
requested. I shall expect my current account and hope to hear how much I am to get for the rebate of duty on our Ardasse, so that I can make a record of it all. Meanwhile, with cordial

as a reply.

It is true that, because of the great quantities, wine will not sell here in the least. There is
enough lying here to last for two years, and it is in so many hands that one cannot undercut
prices without selling at a great loss. To tell you the truth, there is never any profit which an
isolated individual can make here for there are too many old-established wine merchants who
obtain the wine on their own account and drive no other trade. These people have all the tap-
houses under their thumbs so itis quite impossible for anyone to compete against them except
with loss to his colleagues. Also there is no truth in the idea that one can send it for an
immediate sale, much less procure remittances, because this is a commodity which is sold on
long-term credit. Thus, I could not give your friends full satisfaction, but if I can be of service
to you or your friends with any other commodity you may freely command me. I would be
grateful for your recommendation, and you may be assured that your friends will be
completely satisfied, for I shall take care of their interests as if they were my own.

The brandy will all be sold, some for 300 and some for 280 dollars per hogshead, according
to what Mr Cletcher tells me about that which he has taken back since his return from the
country. But of the other, little or none is sold, and according to what Mr Cletcher tells me he
is on the point of selling to one of the wine dealers. I cannot see him getting more than 140
dollars per hogshead on average, for there is much bad stuff among them. Your friends have
been very badly served by those in France. I can obtain 160 and 180 dollars per hogshead for
the best sort, and the longer the time it takes the more loss by leakage occurs, so that from two
bad barrels the best one must be chosen.

I am very relieved that you will be suffering no loss by the cargo since you are not
involved, but I wish that those who are involved might get as much profit as possible.

The un-free toll and expenses are too great. May God transfer their loss to someone else!
You will be further informed about what happens regarding the sale. For your report about
what is happening in trade I thank you—it may come in useful. It is very obvious that our
goods this year in England will cost [—missing—]. Ordinary iron is selling for 26 and 27
dollars; fine iron at 28, 29 and 30 dollars of the sort which was previously selling for 33
dollars, but this decline has come about because there is no shipping-freight available for
[England] or Holland, and many goods are lying about. Garcopper costs 244 dollars, and wire
336 to 340 dollars per shippound. Salt is now put out of the market and the first [to arrive] has
been sold by me for 134 dollars per ton, and that is for two ships’ lading, for your
information. Just how things will develop in the spring time will tell, and you will be
informed.

You complain about the Österby and Gimo iron, that it is not as good as it used to be, yet
that ought not to be so for I can think of no change which has taken place. Please let me know
at once, exactly, what it is about which you are complaining. Winter is now close on our heels, so the waters are beginning to freeze. Wherewith I remain, &c.","Amsterdam: 24 1/4 (Marks at 1 month's sight).

It seems that I must remain patient about my Marglitzer linens since they are of the good
old-fashioned sort and not of the kind currently being made. I believe they were once
without demand for six years but were then much sought after and their price leaped up.
That time could come again for they are no longer being made.

which had been sold on credit are now at rock-bottom prices, so that the commitments I have

2 Of some 2.225 barrels of copper-farthing blanks delivered to England by the Cronströms between 1672 and
1675, the 326 were the last consignment, received in February 1675 —CTB, 1672-75, p. 478.","I am most gratefully obliged to you for the various letters I have received from you in the
course of the year, with useful information about trade and what has been happening with
Swedish goods. As I have been selling my products here at home there has been no material
on which to keep up our correspondence. However, this letter is occasioned by the fact that
Commerce Councillor Nicholas Preus is going to London from Gothenburg with a certain
royal commission, and I have asked him asa friend to settle the account concerning the blank
farthings which was in Mr Burkin’s hands. I understand he has died and I want to recover the
remaining effects, which I transferred some time ago to Jeremias van Racy in Amsterdam.
Since I understand that Van Raey has employed you before in his affairs I am sure that you are
well-informed about the matter, so I am asking you as a friend to supply Mr Preus with all the
information you may have and give him good advice about how this task may be handled
with the greatest circumspection.

For this, it is necessary to know:

1. Who is now managing the estate of the late Mr Burkin and what do you know about such
person?

2. In what relationship does the family of Burkin stand with the Controller of the Mint, Sir
James Hoare?

3. If the copper farthings are still in use, and if new farthings were minted for 1675, '76 and
77?

4. If the remaining 182 barrels of farthings are still in the hands of the Burkin family, or
whether they have been delivered to the Mint?

5. Whether, of the whole consigment of 326 barrels,(2) only 144 were paid out of the Mint, or
whether perhaps Mr Burkin retained them all in his hands and kept a running account with
the Mint?

About this and anything more which may serve to illuminate the task of Mr Preus, please
inquire closely and let him know. I shall be most greatly obliged to re-pay you with
gratitude, friendship and service for any assistance you may be able to give me.

The reason why I began to get involved in this trade was to help my brother Abraham
Cronström, in so far that the deliveries might be completed according to contract, and it was
my intention to give the commission to your dear wife, Madame Marescoe. But my brother
warned me off, saying that the firm was not reliable but on the contrary suffered from great
internal jealousies and that nothing but quarrels would ensue since Burkin had been promised
by the contract that he would have an exclusive commission; and if it came into other hands it
would be regarded as raw copper yet pay duty as if it were manufactured copper—as it
mostly did afterwards.

I shall expect a regular report about what happens in this and other aspects of Swedish
trade, especially in what ways one can get coal to Stockholm at the best possible price. I
should also be glad to know the price of malt and hops in England, for my guidance, with
information about how English malt compares with that of Danzig or Riga.

drawn on John Croger so that you could get it accepted and return it, which I am accordingly
waiting for. Since then I have received both your letters of the 19th and 22nd of February, to
which I must say that I am very sorry you have refused to accept my drafts. This is the first
time that has been done to me. It might be the case that they were drawn payable to a good
friend of mine and were only done pro forma, but while the first is true the second is quite the
contrary. You should know perfectly well that when I draw a bill of exchange which affects
the honour of a merchant I am careful that I do not over-draw, for I am aware that any one
who accepts bills without the security of effects is giving me credit, and if he is not inclined to
do it he will not pass them. Therefore I have to know that he has sufficient effects, which on
this occasion I have done. But, from the beginning, I have noticed that you have had no
inclination to accept anything unless it was covered by effects which you have not sold so I
have not asked, thinking that with God’s help I might avoid having to do so. But with my
effects sold at a fixed price to reliable customers, as you have done, no one can claim that I
have been served in conformity with the original proposal on which I began to correspond
with you. I am more astonished that you have not been willing to honour my drafts than you
are astonished that I drew them! After all, to accept drafts and pay them as money comes in
from the sale of goods does not require one to venture any capital. And one is getting a
handsome commission. People without capital can easily do that. If one wants more, one
must stipulate better conditions. I must declare that I am heartily annoyed that you have done
such dishonour to my drafts, all the more as I know you were not lacking sufficient means to
fulfil them. It never occurred to me, with regard to you personally, that you would not be
sufficiently confident about the reliability of your customers to give me credit for my effects
and that I would thus come to suffer some loss. So far, God be praised, I have found no reason
to complain about my correspondents and it would depress me to find the first grounds with
you—God forbid! Now patience.

I shall expect a sale account and current account from you, which you will please send by
the next post so that I can see how we stand with one another. I can make calculations about it
myself since nothing is forthcoming on my latest drafts. If the consignment which went to
Bristol has been paid for please remit me the proceeds in good bills payable at sight, for you
have already deducted your commission.

Since I see that the English are demanding £4 sterling for freight on a last of tar from
Stockholm, and will not sail for less, please do no more about it. I shall arrange for everything
to come here first, which I can have done for f.18 per last at the most; and I can get it carried
from here to [London] for 18 or 20 schellings per last, so my freight will not amount to more
than £3. And by that means I hope to demonstrate to you that you will have no reason to
complain about having to advance money on my behalf, and I shall no longer have to live in
fear of insults to my drafts.

fully that the exchange has fallen greatly through fear of a war, which does not surprise us
greatly since it has done so here even more and already no money can be got below 32s.
However, it now seems that there is a change approaching and a lot of money is arriving
without bills of exchange, whereby we hope that the exchange will rise again. We are glad
that you have lent our money to the East India Company at interest, but since we have no
knowledge of the security we are well satisfied that you should enjoy the profit from it, and if
the exchange rises again we expect you to remit in reliable bills and trust that you will
manage it without loss.

Everything is going contrary to expectations, and one can place no reliance on any price

raisins from Malaga are at 21 ML and in baskets they are 11 ML. Indigo is at 6 1/2g.

I have ordered Tomloo to consign 100 Hungarian plates to you for my account, which you
will do your best to sell on their arrival at the highest possible price to good and reliable
customers. I urge you to see to this because of the bankruptcies which are happening
everywhere. And when I see the results and find them satisfactory I shall not only continue to
send even bigger consignments which I have lying ready at Hamburg, with Tomloo and

Stockholm burghers. The Riksdag was held recently in Helmstadt and because I learned that
there was an English ship lying at Gothenburg whose captain was thinking of returning to
England I decided that I would go over to England aboard this ship. But then I got news from
Stockholm that my wife is very unwell and thus I have to cancel my journey and travel from
here to Stockholm, which is the cause of this letter and my request that, as a friend, you will
buy me the goods set out in the memorandum below and send them to me in the first
available ship on the same conditions on which I sent you goods last summer through Mr
Piltarffand subsequently wrote to you about—namely, that you will buy the goods and ship
them in your own name and deliver them to me in the river or waters of Stockholm. Mr
Pilcarff has already informed you, as you may remember, of the same conditions on which
you sent goods to Oloff & Nicholas Törne last summer.

I am sending you enclosed herewith four first bills of exchange drawn on Samuel van
Breda, to pay RD 1.400 in Amsterdam and RD 600 bank-money in Amsterdam, which RD
2.000 you will get paid, place to account and employ as instructed. The goods which I am
likewise shipping with this Captain Hiel are 300 pieces of copper money plates, which are
going under the name of John Harwitz! who serves James Leyell and Callender. He has been
here and is sending the plates to his father and has written to inform him that I shall be
receiving these 300 pieces of plate from him. But since I cannot come over I beg you to
receive the 300 plates from Harwy, pay his expenses and then sell them. Place the proceeds to
my account and employ them as instructed. In themselves the proceeds will be too little for
the proposed purchases, but with the first ships leaving Stockholm this spring you will
receive 60 slb of copper-wire, which are already lying ready at Stockholm. I had thought of
sending them last autumn but had no opportunity. In addition I have another so slb at the
works in Norrköping which I shall get as soon as the waters are open, all of which I shall send
to you. I shall make good anything more you disburse on my behalf at the rate of 1/2 per cent
per month interest until you have the payment for my goods in your hands, in accordance
with the terms of the contract which I sent over last summer through Mr Piltarff. I also hope
that the remainder of the money due has now come in. As I said in the last letter I sent over —
another time you must not sell to people who do not pay up promptly. Furthermore, I beg
you on receipt of this to serve me well with good quality wares at reasonable prices. You will
buy the dozens and kerseys in Hull and the others in London, and let them all go in the first
available ship under your name for delivery to me in the river before Stockholm. I know no
other way of doing this except according to the contract, by which you will pay the customs
or duties in England, insurance on everything and the Sound tolls at Helsingor. In return your
profit will be reckoned at 12 to 15 per cent. I know no other way except on these conditions,
which I must insist upon. All the kerseys and serges and [—?I are to be laid with three pieces

report concering the salt ships which are coming from St Ubes. I shall be glad if you would
share with me anything more you may learn about them. In my opinion, Sweden will be
adequately supplied from here this year, and if more comes from England matters will be
worse than they were last year. But if there is a war, England will be needing the salt itself.

Your iron prices will have to be higher if one is going to bring it from Stockholm. And the
freight charges will have to be lower, which is likely to be the case if all the salt ships arrive
there and push down the rates. According to my calculations £16 will scarcely be enough
with these freight and exchange rates.

I shall expect an account of the iron, and with it a report on how much pan-iron from that
works you are going to keep in your hands.

The wine ought not to be going straight to Stockholm where it is now so cheap that it
would be better if it came directly here. However, it is best that you sell it and close the
account, and if these damaging exchange rates continue for a while I would prefer to have my
money received there, unless arrangements can be made for investing it in something else. Let
me know at once how things stand so that I can write and tell you to whom the money
should be given at Stockholm.

I shall expect to get an account of the 56 slb of wire which still remains unsold, together
with an account of the wine.
In Sweden they have had a bad winter, so many works have been poorly supplied and
although they believed that iron would casily maintain its price there is at the moment not
much demand here. I shall be glad to learn your opinion about it in [England].

Some French goods are still not prohibited here. We still hope for a peace, but if it should
be delayed it might well happen that England will go to war with France and then we might
decide on a general prohibition also. But that would be to embargo oneself, since no ships
would be able to sail and no one would be free, and one would know all too easily if anything
came from France. Je suis de vos avis touchant la gerre. Si vous en pouvez apprend quelque
chose par M. Leyonberg en avance vous m’obiligerez. The Riksdag in Sweden has ended
well, with money and men supplied from all sides. Si je ne me trompe cette année encore

Please keep the bond for it by you. .

We must also thank you for offering to advance us money if we should have need of it. We
shall probably not have to do so unless the exchange rises significantly. It would be welcome
to us if you would bear in mind the need to sell our remaining brass and handle it as if it were
your own.

We have obtained acceptance of the three bills of exchange drawn for your account,
together amounting to RD 1.400 current money, drawn in Stockholm by the directors of the
Tar Company on Samuel van Breda here, dated the 12th of January last (Old Style) and
payable three months after date. When they fall due we shall procure payment and, after
deducting our commission and brokerage, make you returns in good bills. Van Breda makes
some difficulties about paying us on these bills since they were endorsed to you by Thomas
Perman without instruction to follow his order. And he also forgot to put his name under the
endorsement of one of them. As we understand he is in [London] we shall expect as soon as
possible a second copy duly endorsed.

Of the two bills of exchange, each of RD 300 drawn on the above-said Van Breda and
payable in Hamburg, we have also obtained acceptance and, according to your instructions,
sent them there to Claus Bene.

We see that a war between England and France is firmly expected by you. Here we
 consider peace to be not entirely beyond hope. May the Lord grant us some salvation. Wecommend you to his protection and remain, &c.

please return to me the bill of exchange. The endorser will doubtless know how to claim the
payment. That the drawer has been deceived by the acceptor cannot be blamed on the
endorser, and from whom could he learn that no value had been paid for it? Here such excuses
are not valid, for the acceptor must pay without any evasion. For that reason every one
should know from whom he accepts bills of exchange.

they come for the Downes and thence with English or Dutch convoy. Hetherto our English
shipping have bin inployed in that trade but ifa breach follow with France it wil meet with a

which I have seen what prices Swedish goods are fetching in [England]. lam most grateful to
you, but because of the pending war between France and England and other sad
circumstances that one sees developing more and more, every day, one dares not risk sending
anything from here. One is living here almost as if one were bound hand and foot, and the
iron, garcopper and copper-wire which comes to market here is mostly sold to strangers.
There can only be one person in a hundred who is currently exporting on his own account,
and when anything does get done it is in the name of someone overseas, which still carries its
dangers. Apart from that, we are living in great ignorance about what is happening abroad
since our correspondence has been taken away and it can easily be three months before one
can get any answer from Holland and [England]. This creates uncertainty, so that it is nearly
impossible to get anything insured, and when correspondence is removed in such a way the
insurers are not happy to venture without taking a high premium, which is enough to
smother any profits which the owner should have enjoyed. And if the ship should on its way
suffer any mishap in these circumstances the insurers are very evasive, so that one has to write
off half one’s capital. But for you in [England], who have a punctual correspondence from all
places, it is much easier to arrange anything for your own account.

Garcopper is presently very cheap here, at 235 to 236 dollars, and it may well fall to 230
dollars. Fine iron, serviceable for London, is at 30 or 32 dollars, medium quality at 27 to 28
and coarse anchor iron at 25 to 26 dollars. Copper-wire is at 270 to 280 dollars.

So, if you want to arrange for something to come on your account, please keep me in mind
and be assured that you will be as well served by me as by any others in Stockholm.
Meanwhile, people are in good hopes of peace and trust that it will not come to a rupture
between England and France. This would be the best for the whole of Christendom, and I
trust also that all the princes who are engaged in this war will feel it too and already have their
share of weariness.

trade [in England]. I am most obliged to you, and beg you to continue as opportunity arises.

In my opinion it would be best now to see which way, and how, matters develop between
England and France.

Iron is now readily fetching 32 dollars for fine quality. Wire is 290 and garcopper 236 to
240 copper dollars per shippound. May God grant peace! There ought to be something to be
done with copper, especially when the East India Company in London wants to make its
yearly contract, about which you could do a lot through Mr Lethieullier who I beg you to
grect heartily with my dutiful respects. Likewise, something could be done with voyage iron
but in these troubled times it is best that it remains at home. I shall set them to work on it.

Similarly, one ought to be able to agree with the Tar Company for 1.200 to 1.500 lasts of
tar and 300 to 400 lasts of pitch yearly, as you mentioned, but during this war I do not believe
the English here will allow it, unless it could be arranged in [London] under the pretext that
His Majesty the King of Great Britain wants to be assured of having such a yearly quantity in
the country and, accordingly, His Majesty has agreed with you (or someone else) to procure
such a quantity and consequently forbidden (or, at least, will not permit) anyone else to bring
in such commodities unless you (or whoever it is in whose name it is done) shall permit it and
unless he charters it or orders it through you. That could turn out well, and if you would like
to take a half share I would do my best here and you could arrange your half in [London].
And with the ships that fetch the goods we could send other commodities of one kind or
another on which something could be gained in [England], and now is the right time to be
thinking about it, for when we have peace there will be many standing ready to do so. Thus,
if you have any inclination to take part, I beg you to let me know at once and I will see what is
possible to arrange here.
Lacking the account of the plates which you have sold I shall be glad to learn how much
they rendered, for my guidance.

At the earliest opportunity please send me six good watches and chains that work
correctly, of the kind which you bought for Mr Hedenström, since I have been asked for
them by good friends.

Bless you, and with heartiest regards I remain, &c.",,C. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & JACOB DAVID,DUTCH,1678,11 MAY 1678,15 Jul. 1678,6 Aug. 1678,,462,,

28th past, and from these we have seen in full what you have to say on the subject of trade,
with your opinions about it and news of what ships have recently arrived from one place or
another. For all this we are very grateful

We are sorry that the times are so miserable that one can find nothing about which to
correspond, for so far we have seen no commodities from which we could profit—there is no
consumption. The ginger which came in these latest ships—nice, plump, clean, brown
ginger —was allowed to sell for 34g with 83 per cent rebate, prices never heard of before,
with fine, white scraped ginger at 84g, but there is no demand. At 15s in [London] it is very
low; other friends have it for 14s, but their letters are more recent, for your last, of the 28th,
has only just reached us today.

Oil has fallen considerably here, fetching RD 90 for the last three or four weeks, and now
Malaga oil can be had for RD 68 and Seville at RD 70. Two ships are expected direct from
Gallipoli, and if they arrive safely we believe it will decline even more. Good cardamon is at
34g. Ardasse will have to fall lower in [London] as.a good quantity of silk from the East Indies
has arrived in Holland and none is selling here or elsewhere. For the war has totally ruined
trade and it seems that instead of the anticipated peace we can expect a harder and fiercer war.
May God avert the latter and grant the former! As long as these troubles continue we expect
nothing good.

However, we would be interested to know about the cost of good English calf-skins,
smooth and white, prepared in [London], and the worser quality prepared in Hull, and if the
customs duty on them is high. We shall be glad to learn, at your convenience, whether there
is any change or decline in prices, and if pepper can be had for 12d.

June and cannot understand why it has been held up for so long. As I told you in my last,
Captain John Bate arrived here safely, and I have been diligently trying to sell our ginger as
quickly as it can be received from the ship in order to reduce expenses, but it will not succeed
because I have been obliged to bring it in to the warehouse. Although I have been
superintending for the last two nights the captain has only delivered 193 sacks and I shall not
pay him his freight until all the rest are received.

Since then I have sold 150 sacks, namely roo to Mr De Heusch and 50 to Adrian Justus at
3 3/4g with 8 2/3 per cent rebate for payment in bank money. They will collect them in the
morning and I shall try to sell the rest so that I can send you the account. In my last letter I
ordered another 100 sacks of brown ginger to be bought at 15s or below, and if you are
interested in going halves let us take 200 sacks. This I now confirm. You know what sort of
quality to obtain. What I have here is good, and the freight is very reasonable, which will
make it easier to have a coarser quality. It will be useful for your guidance to know that if the
sacks are rather bigger the expenses here can be better managed, for one has to pay just as
much tare, brokerage and other expenses if the sack is of 100, 120, or 80 lb., so if the quality is
good the bigger sacks are to be preferred.

I hope you have performed my commission for white, scraped ginger. Regarding
Bermuda tobacco, as I said before, please do not pay more than sd, and for good Barbados
sugar do not give more than 21s 6d to 22s, buying 10 butts for my account or 20 butts for us
in partnership. And it may be useful for your guidance to know that one makes the most loss
by the tare on the heaviest butts, for here the tare is 14 per cent while in [England] it isas much
for a heavy as for a light butt. Such Barbados sugar as has arrived here is selling for 5 3/4 — 7/8g on
average, with 8 2/3 per cent rebate. Because a rupture is still foreseen please take care that what
you send to me is loaded in ships which are going with convoy. It would be very unwise to
load it in German ships sailing with French passes for I fear the English will not suffer it. I
hope you know how to guard against that.

I have been told today that Nath. Mathew has absented himself from the Exchange and as
a result I fear his father in London may follow him. I long to know that the £100 drawn on
him, falling due on the 24th instant and remitted to you on the 5th, has been settled.

have seen what you asked to know about the trade in whale-fins.

In reply, we can tell you that we seldom receive fins from Biscay, for our friends in
Holland send us as many as we can sell here. Those most wanted here are the blackest or the
biggest kind, but no small ones. Furthermore, we see that you say that those from Biscay
weigh from 4, 43 to 5 lb., per piece, so they must be nearly all of the same size, and they
would sell for 16s[oldi] per lb., more or less, according to quality. The white ones should be
thrown out, otherwise they cause offence here. The black and dried ones will all sell as there
are none in town apart from those in our hands, for your information. Dutch fins are also
from 3, 3+ to 34 lb., and 100 ]b. Dutch-weight amounts to 150 lb. here for wares which do not
perish, such as lead, iron, pepper, or the like, and whale-fins of one type always spoil more
than the other since they are shipped moist.

A piece-of-cight is worth £5, or 100 s/oldi]. Charges on fins, pepper, lead as well as many
other goods are few since they are mostly sought after duty-free and only have to be stored.
Concerning warchouse rent, it is ordinarily (though contrariwise for all cloths, bays, says,
linens) a duty charged on the seller of 1 per cent ona valuation of the goods, though the prices
have been once again raised. Pepper sells at present for 105 soldi per lb., great lead at £164 per cantar which is the same as 100 lb. Dutch or 150 lb. of theirs. If there is anything in which we

to answer your letter of the 9th of August—I mean to say, the 30th of July—I shall do so
here.

My friends at Stockholm have been unable to hinder the consignments which are reaching
[England], or those which are yet to arrive, but from the 15th/25th of July you can be assured
that there will be no more goods to be had from Englishmen or others at Stockholm, except
from me, because there are some Dutch ships there which are taking away all there is to be
had. For your instruction, it is not advisable that we should sell anything at present but rather
let the others undercut each other. Our time will come. As already mentioned, I shall not be
arranging for any more ships to go to [England] this year. In 1676, over 3,000 lasts of tar and
600 lasts of pitch were sent to England, which were altogether consumed before any of mine
arrived, but this year, besides my total, less than a quarter as much will be shipped.

Concerning what you propose about the conditions on which I can draw £4 per last on tar
and £6 per last on pitch at the arrival of the ships: for the reasons you allege I shall draw no
more than £4 per last on the tar until it is sold, but once sold I may (if I need to) always draw
the surplus on each ship’s lading without waiting for the money to come in. And on the pitch,
since each last of pitch costs me twice as much as the tar, I would gladly see you allow me to
draw £8 per last, which is not unreasonable. As for bad debts, I shall guarantee you, and
likewise against the risk of fire (which God forbid!) but I cannot agree to allow you to sell to
others than the previously specified tar-buyers, since you judge the danger of bad debts to be
so great.

You request that I should reimburse your outlay if you need it: I am always quite willing
to reimburse you within two months of being informed by delivering over to you such
effects as will suffice but on the condition that you only charge 4 per cent commission on their
account. On these conditions, and provided that you always follow my orders about selling,
we can again continue to deal with one another.

la vostre pouvoir vous rendre quelque service qui vous fust agreable. Pour satisfaire a ce que
vous nous demandez nous vous dirons, qu’il est vray que Mons. Hersemitte comme I’un des
directeurs en cette ville de la Compagnie du Nort recevoit les marchandises que en venoient
pour le compte de la ditte Compagnie, laquelle avoit des previlesges qui consistoient en ce
qu’ils payoient moins de drois que les particuliers, mais cette Compagnie est a present comme
estinte. Nous ne scavons sy a present que la paix sera faitte ils reprendrons en quelque facon ce
commerce, mais nous voyons qu'il y a desja long temps qu’on travaillea la liquidation. Ils ont
vandus tous leurs navires et tout ce qu’ils avoient de matteriaux et chose propre pour la
construction, ainsy nous croyons qu’il ne viendra plus de marchandises pour ce compte-la. La
principale consommation du bre, gouildron et chanvre est ce qu il en faut pour les magazins
de Rochefort, dont les achapts ce font publiquement pour toutes les choses dont l’on a besoing
pour les magazins, et presentment ils sont assignes pour la douze et quinze de ce mois. On
achepte la a livrer de celuy quy fait le meilleur marche, et mesme le Roy fournit a l’advance
une partie du payement. Les marchandises que l’on y livre ne payent points de droits d’entrees.

ordinairement d’Hollande mais nous estimons qu’on les peut tirer a meilleur marché
d’Angleterre. Le chanvre seroit de longue vante, a cause de la grande quantité que s’en

plate, sent as an experiment, and am now waiting to hear what happened regarding its sale.
Those here who work for the Germans on commission selling this commodity, most of
which is sold for two or three months credit, stand liable to their employers in return for a
commission of 2 per cent in total, while others only enjoy a 1 1/2 per cent commission. There
may not be much of this type. I wish you could dispose of plenty. I would then send you a
good quantity every year. I await your report, together with advice. If the Marglitzer [linen]
is not in better demand let us make an end of it. I shall send you enough of 'X' but it is dearer,
as you should know. I would like to hear what difference is made between the one and the
other in [England].

Everyone is waiting now for the general peace, and as long as we do not haye it I see no
further demand for goods. One ought to give some thought to those countries which
produce them, such as Germany, Poland and Hungary. The great abundance of goods which
come from there keep their prices very low, despite every artifice to raise them. People no
longer have such fat purses.

I am sure that individuals can obtain pepper in [England] for 63d, free on board. Please tell me if any more ships are expected from the East Indies. I remain, with regards, &c.

letters of the 29th of January, 15th of February and 12th of April, and as you make no

happening with you as regards trade, and also concerning rumours of war. We here live in
hopes of peace, but what pertains to trade—which is now mostly carried on by the English—
is bad. Some ships have arrived at Stockholm, and two ships loaded with coals from
Newcastle have reached here. Iron is sold at 31 to 32 dollars per shippound; brass-wire is at
290 to 295 dollars per shippound (which is what was at £6 10s with you) and as there are
only 4.000 coils in stock I trust that you will do your best with what you last had, for there
will be no great quantities coming. Because of the bad winter the works could get no supplies
and thus both the brass works and the iron works were at a standstill most of the time. As far
as I am concerned, I am thinking of not exporting anything as long as the war lasts, and am
not a little surprised that the pots and kettles have remained unsold for so long and that people
attribute this to their bad quality. But I know otherwise, for the pots are not to be bettered
and the kettles are no worse than those I have always sent to [England] or Holland. If they
were in Holland they would not remain unsold one month, but it seems to be contrived that
they simply eat up expenses in interest and warehouse rental. I shall await an account from
Hiebenaer of such expenses as you may incur through the law-suit(1) and have them paid, and I
shall make good such expenses as you may have incurred for me concerning Townley.

PERMAN,JD,"This is friendly advice to you, with which I commend you to God’s protection.",STOCKHOLM,STOCKHOLM 8 OCTOBER 1678,1 '...muss der gekauff haben von ein queker...’.,"My most recent letter was on the rst instant, to which I refer, and enclosed herewith follows a
copy of it. lam writing this only because I find I have not replied about the two invoices for
the 3 packs from Hull and the 14 packs from London, which I would have answered long ago
if I had not been prevented by my serious illness. So this will serve as a friendly comment on
the 3 packs of goods from Hull, which I received as per invoice. I was well-satisfied with the
goods, but I do not know where the £5 6s 4d comes from since W. Skinner brings
£16 12s 3d into his account for expenses at Hull.

But, my dear Mr David, I have something to say about the 14 packs from London! Some
of the wares are good, and some of them are bad, though I found the total number correct
according to the invoice. The pack No. 1 with 30 pieces of northern kerseys was so bad that I
cannot describe it. You put them down at 17d to 18d and 109d, but if you offered me such
tattered goods for 10d I would not have them! They are not half as good as cottons, and are
nothing else but trash. So, likewise, are most of the dozens. I have never seen such wretched
goods. You must have bought the dozens and kerseys from a Quaker[?].(1) He has put two
pieces together, but he must have been a scoundrel who sold you the 30 pieces of kersey and
40 dozens. He has deceived you like a fool. You know that I ordered you to buy the dozens
and kerseys in Hull and not in London, and to have three kersey pieces wrapped in one but
not two dozens in one. In London one can get no good dozens, only old, wretched things
which seem at first like boards and full of worms, and the inside piece is so awful that I am
ashamed to look at it. You have charged me for them at 3s 8d, 4s and 4s 6d and so on, but
they are not worth 2s on average. They are nothing but rubbish.

However, the cottons and the bays and silk camisoles are good. I note that you put 3 pieces
of bays wrapped up in one, but that is not what I ordered. I wanted each piece on its own, and
the camisoles among the yellow bays, some in each piece. I was soon able to dispose of them.
The three pieces of bays were very heavy and not very well sewn together with strong thread
or sail-yarn. In packs 9, 10 and 11 were serges, with which I was also well satisfied, as much
with the goods as the packing with three pieces wrapped in one. In pack 12 I was also well
pleased with the coloured cloths, and in packs Nos. 13 and 14 I was content with the pieces,
although the colours do not match well with each other. All in all, I am well satisfied with
them except with the wretched 40 dozens and 30 pieces of kerseys. You must not buy such commodities in London another time. This is friendly advice to you, with which I commend
you to God’s protection.

[P.S.] The 30 pieces of kersey from Hull were not laid, three pieces in one, according to my
orders, instead of each piece on its own. Another time, strict attention must be given to
following orders.
N.B. On closing this letter I received yours of the 6th of August under Mr Pincier’s cover,
from which I see that you have ordered some goods from Hull. In reply, I must say that I
would rather not have had them because I will not receive them at the right time. I have

sent aboard Captain Blauwers have been sold to two people who will pay in two and four
months time. I had hoped you would sell to the Guinea Company, or to someone else, for
cash payment as you always assured me you would in your letters. I would have been much
happier to see you had done so, but since you have done otherwise there is no point in
changing it. I hope these people are doubly reliable, otherwise I wish you had rather left my
goods unsold and waited for a cash-customer. I must content myself with the thought that
the transaction will have been a good one if the people turn out to be good.

You write of '£5 4s at 4 months’ and ‘£5 2s at 2 months’. This must be an error, and
should be £6, otherwise I would be doing badly and could not approve of the sale. I have
seen in other letters from [London] that such plates can fetch £6 4s for cash. Furthermore, I
hope you will be satisfied in both cases with 2 per cent commission so that I can enjoy some
profit thereby. This will give me some motive for continuing, otherwise I shall have to
suspend the trade. Sheet copper at £6 ros is a bad price—with that one can expect no profit
but only loss. When, at the existing rate of exchange, one can make £7 sterling I shall send
some more. Because I have my own mill I can provide you with a quantity of sheet-copper
plates and pots at a fixed price, when I know what assortment sells. Only I would rather trade
for payment in cash and would only grant two to three months credit when I can stipulate a
good price from reliable people.

Likewise, I shall also send black latten and white when you can give mea fixed price which
you will stand by. It is a commodity which is in demand in [London].

I thank you for honouring my draft of £150 sterling, because the rate of exchange was
such that it might have been refused. In order to enjoy this rate again I am taking the liberty
of drawing another £100 sterling, not doubting that you will honour it with due acceptance.

I have loaded 50 pieces of plate in Leonard Bushell for my account, marked 'L'. He will
be ready to sail in a few days time. With my next letter a bill of lading will follow. I cannot agree with Captain Meerwich, who has already departed, about the freight. I rely on you to

Our journey was extremely successful and no less comfortable since we were only at sea
for two days which passed very quietly. It can happen that one is not at all comfortable at sea,
but if it does not last long one can endure it.

I probably learned more English on the way than during my stay at London as it was my
turn to do all the talking. The two other gentlemen did not know enough to order a shoulder
of mutton, so I got us a piece of roast beef and besides that enjoyed very fine company.

I have spoken to Mr Botte. I think it will be all right; I shall speak with him farther.

From Sweden I shall order 400 to 500 slb of pan-iron to be made for the coming year.
None has been made this year as the summer has been rather dry. I shall get them to make

I have received the galls from Cutler, but I have to tell you (although to my regret, for I

greatly dislike complaining) that I am astonished you should send me such goods. Ten or

twelve of the sacks are passable, although I had hoped for better, but the rest are so extremely
bad that I have never had the like in twenty years of trading. It is bad, uncultivated stuff,
mostly of bush-galls. If one takes them out of the sack with a ladle[?] or dish(1) there are no
blue galls to be seen underneath but only wild galls. What can I say? It is annoying to be
served in such a way. One pays over good money for it yet is obeyed in nothing even though
I gave such explicit orders and asked you to send only good, plump, blue galls or else nothing
at all, and not to quibble about 6d or 1s more. I do not know how to sell such terrible stuff
here, much less can I send it to my friends. I would lose their commissions. I would like to
know, what am I to do with these awful galls? If you do not believe me you can tell Mr
Ruland or Mr Lethieullier so that they can see them and give you better advice. As I do not
seek your harm, I would rather that you did not desire mine. I am heartily sorry that I have to
press this. I still need 6 or 8 sacks of choice quality galls, and to my great annoyance I must buy them from others, which is very painful. God preserve you, &c.

[P.S.] If the galls were tolerably good, and ifamong the remaining 12 or 14 sacks of bad ones
there were still some blue ones to be found or seen, I would not be so annoyed, but there are
enough such galls here and one dare not procure them from [England] without great expense

safely received. We have found the goods to be correct but are not so well satisfied with the
15 per cent which you have charged on top of the expenses, which in these times we regard as
very inappropriate. All the goods which we order from Holland—not only those wares
which are sent on credit, but also those which our factor buys for us for cash—are sent
directly to us and we are aware of no other expenses apart from those which are customary in
Holland. We trust that all goods will be as free in English ships as they are in Dutch, and if
they are to be burdened with such large costs we would do better to despatch our returns to
Holland and order English goods from there. They would not cost as much as they do on
such conditions as you have stipulated for us in the account. Things are very different now
from what they were before, with Mr Darbey. Then the English were sole masters and we
had to allow them to do as they liked, but now things are different. If you will not treat us
reasonably it will oblige us to do business with someone else. Last year Mr William Cooper
sent us some goods but was aware of nothing more than ordinary charges. You can take it
from this that we will not stand for it, or pay for it. We recently sent you wire, which reached
you unhindered; why then cannot our goods come unmolested?

If you will serve us as a factor and provide us with good insurers every time we will do
further business together and order larger amounts than ever before. But if not, we shall have
to find another who will serve us in return for his commission.

England with a reasonably fluent command of German.","My last letter to you was on the 24th of December. Since then I find myself with your
welcome letters of the 6th, 13th, 20th of December and 3rd instant, and have seen thereby
that you had not yet received the Barbary almonds which you bought for me, and that you
were of the opinion that you ought to delay their receipt for as long as possible. I am glad of
that since we will not be having open water very soon and in the meantime the almonds
would suffer rather from the rats, like those on a ship from Barbary which delivered its cargo
somewhat damaged. And I note that in this way we may get them cheaper, but I beg you
please make sure that you receive nothing but good quality, for bad quality goods are no use
to me at any price. Please keep yourself informed if newly arrived goods are sold at lower
prices.

I am glad that the £85 remitted for your account was accepted. I have received the protest
concerning the £100 on B. Sirps and will know what to do with it. Concerning the £100
which you have paid for the honour of Lubers, I have debited you for £100 18s 4d. I could
have wished that you had returned the bill of exchange together with the second protest, but
as you have not done so by now it should not be necessary for us to correspond about it again,
and I believe that in future this Lubers will behave himself with more discretion than he has
shown towards me.

I have sold your Jamaican tobacco to Hans. P. Dimpfel at 42s per lb., for cash, payable in
bank money. Please make a note of it. With my next letter I shall send you an account. I could
not push the price up any higher, and I would rather have taken 1/8s less in bank money than
sell it for current money, for the agio on it is 34 per cent and there is uncertainty whether it
might not go higher. I have also sold 48 sacks of our scraped ginger which came with
Hendrick Weever and delivered them yesterday to Hermann Harvart for 7 1/8g with 8 2/3 rebate
payable in bank money. The price is rather poor and we shall not gain much by it, but as there
is so little demand for it now I did not want to let the opportunity pass. The account of this
also will be sent by my next, and if the money has come in a remittance will be made to you.
Meanwhile I think we shall also get in the money for our last bale of Ardasse because the
debtor has promised it. As for our Bermuda tobacco, with the waters closed I can still find no
buyers, but if any opportunity offers itself it will not be neglected. I wait to hear if any nice
Virginia-leaf can be had in [England] and at what price and when the ships are expected. I
shall inquire how the purchaser fares with your tobacco and keep you informed. As far as I
can discover he sends it into Germany in place of another variety.

I see that you have been persuaded to believe that one cannot learn any good German here
and as a result have requested your servant! to be sent to some place in Germany where he can
better perfect the language. I would gladly see to that if did not believe that it would not be
profitable either for you or your servant, for you ought to consider the fact that he will not
learn to pronounce the language like a born-German within five years and will be little use to
you unless he can write the language correctly, which is what you want him mostly to do,
and he can just as well learn to write here as in Germany, for there is no difference; and he is
already so far advanced that he can read and understand any book in High German just as
well, if not better, than Dutch and also speaks High German, so it only remains for him to
learn the style of German letters, which cannot be easily done except in a counting-house. I
hope to help him find one, and expect to hear from houses in Nüremberg. If, in answer to
this, you persist in your plan I shall arrange it but I consider it unnecessary, for your
information. Enclosed herewith is a letter from him which may be useful to you.

Regarding your good wishes for the newly-commenced year, I most heartily thank you
and pray to God to preserve you, your wife and children in good health and prosper you in
every way he can in this and many coming years, which I trust the Lord will do and keep you
in his protection, remaining, &c.

We have now been busy for some years, employing all means to obtain our payment from
Mr Willem Momma, in which we have so far made little or no progress, and there seems to
be little chance of us escaping without a serious loss. The best that we have been able to
contrive is to arrange for him to go on managing his works and to supply him with a quantity
of copper which, in exchange, he returns back again as manufactured brass. The wages for it
are deducted from his debt and although this will take a very long time (and also cannot be
done without employing a good deal of money) we have decided it is better to deal with it on
this basis than to let the debt run on still longer. But we believe there is still nothing that can
be done for you as long as you have not settled accounts with Momma and got him to
acknowledge the debt, which will only be obtained with difficulty, for according to our
observation he will stir up some dispute. In his letter of January the 3rd, which we received
yesterday, he complains much that his goods remain for so long unsold in London, being
astonished that his kettles and pots have not been sent to us to sell in accordance with the
orders which he gave to you last summer, since the proceeds would be made good to you.
Having got no answer about this he asks us to write to you to find what reason there is for
delay, to which we await your decision. And in case you feel some difficulty, for fear that we
shall make our claims on it, we hope it will not inhibit you, assuring you that if they can be
sold here the proceeds will be sent to you. With regard to our kettles and pots, we have
hitherto not restricted you to any price limit and once again we beg you to make an end of the matter the sooner the better so that the account can be closed. With heartiest regards, we

desire faire une petite emplette pour un essay, en suitte si le compte tourne augmenter la commission.’ He asked for
consignments to be sent via Bremen to Mons. Marcus de Medoch and authorized David to draw his bills on
Giovanni Christoforo Pommer at Venice. Having seen the price of English tin as £3 4s per cwt. for blocks and
£3 9s for bars according to the Price Currents he was displeased in June to be charged £3 13s by David for his
consignment of 1o blocks, and the correspondence ceased.","Until now I have not had the honour of being known to you, although you have long been
known to me through your correspondence since I was living with the Messrs De La Bistrate
& Dufay, from whom I have recently parted with all due honour and cordiality. And as I had
observed in what good esteem you were held by the aforementioned gentlemen and that you
were practical and precise in all kinds of trade, I found no difficulty in recommending Mr
Andreas Ingolstetter of Nüremberg to address himself to you,(1) who had requested me to find
him a reputable and reliable correspondent who would be willing to serve him in the
purchase of English tin. He initially wanted to know the varieties and prices of it, and at what
cost it could be delivered to him at Bremen, so that he could see if he would find it profitable,
and in future wants to send for any other English products suitable for Germany. If you are
now inclined to favour him with the raguagly(2) of tin and other wares I have no doubt that in
due course a mutually satisfactory correspondence can be established, especially if the good
God grants us a general peace. You can be assured that he is a man of complete reliability,
precise and accurate in his affairs, of which I can give you certain testimony as I know him
intimately, having lived with him for many years. But in case you do not take my word for
it, since you do not know me, he will be able to inform you of enough reliable people who
will be able to assure you about his condition. In any case, if you join together in a
correspondence his own conduct will give you adequate testimony to his promptitude and
reliability. It is a matter of indifference to him whether you correspond with him in Italian,
French or Low German, though the Low German will be the best for him as you are not
accustomed to writing High German.

Besides Mr Ingolstetter, I have recommended your person and condition to Mr Willem
Grassel at Nüremberg,(3) who will perhaps write to you about a trial purchase of tin, in which
case you would do well to serve him as he is also reputed reliable and is one of the principal
persons in the city, though he is not so intimately known to me as Mr Ingolstetter, who
makes no fuss about himself but goes about his business quietly and confidently. You can, if
you wish, write to them directly in reply when they write to you or, if you judge it necessary,
write to me, giving the letters to the ordinary post to be forwarded by Mr Christian
Meschman. As it suits him that I should come at once to London I shall seek to have the honour of waiting upon you. Meanwhile, with friendly regards, I commend you to God’s

your remembrance and your offer of service. I can have no greater satisfaction than the
honour of your correspondence and therewith the maintenance of our good friendship. But
the times have for so long been so miserable and also so dangerous that one has had enough to
do to preserve oneself, without going to all the trouble of trade. But it may be that we shall
soon have a general peace (unless it is again transferred to another place, which the Almighty
prevent!) by which everyone may recover themselves and trade may begin to improve. May
God grant it and allow me the chance of being able to gain and enjoy your correspondence.
There is occasionally something to be done with goods from [England], if only consumption
were rather better. It has been extremely bad because of the misery throughout Germany,
but undoubtedly it will now improve. Meanwhile I shall attend to your advice and make my
speculations accordingly, wherever there is a chance of profit.

do something about it in partnership, half and half, I shall on news from you make you a

has acquainted me with your name and circumstances.

Although there is still very little going on in trade with England I nevertheless wish to ask
you to write at once and tell me on what conditions you could supply me with genuine
English tin for delivery at Bremen. There is an Englishman here, called Merry, who deals in it
and other wares, but I would gladly have it at first hand so that I can enjoy all possible
advantage. And if we can do business together I shall give you addresses in Amsterdam where
you can inform yourself about me, but I can assure you that you can deal with me without
risk or suspicion.

With other English manufactures there is nothing particular to be done here, except with
stockings, but I supply myself from Hamburg as the English Court(1) will not suffer us to
supply ourselves from London. I once had a bale taken away from me which I only recovered
with great trouble and expense. I was also advised that my stockings would be better made at
Hamburg than my English white woven stockings, since those of their style have better sales.

If you can do something with German wares over there please just commission them. My
business is principally with friends in the Netherlands, Italy and France, supplying them with
Nüremberg and other German manufactures. Your answer would reach me best by way of
Antwerp, either through the post or through Denys Potteau, merchant-factor, who was recommended by my principal correspondent there. I remain always, &c.

meanwhile with your letter of the 11th instant, from which I have seen the prices of sundry
goods as well as your opinion about one sort or another, for all of which I thank you. Sales are
so small that prices are stifled and are as likely to produce losses as profits, as is the case with
those in [London] who have bought pepper from the East India Company, for it cannot be
sold here at 12 1/2g. It is said that a quantity was sold at 12g, and that is how things are with
other goods, as far as one can see, so that one is forced to sit tight. The higher rate of
exchange, as you can see at the foot of this letter, also harms commodity prices. Black ginger
can be had at 3 1/2 to 3 5/8g; scraped ditto, 7g; Caribbean indigo of extremely choice quality, 4 3/4s
with 13 months rebate; Aleppo galls, 47 ML per 100 lb., as before. Whether Turkish or
Levant wares will increase in price through the danger from the Turks, time will tell. The
bale of Ardasse which you last provided is still lying here unsold. The English have got a
quantity, with which they are heavily undercutting the price at 13s, with 10 2/3 per cent
discount, which is reckoned to have been bought in [London] at 9s. The exchange is at 34s 5g
and the net charge for insurance is 2 per cent. Although, as you truly say, the price is low,
nonetheless there is no profit to be made, which is a miserable state of affairs. Of Zerbassi,
Legi and other varieties one can buy here as cheaply as you can offer it in [London]. It is the
most delicate stuff that one could ever see, so wonderfully has that trade been driven. If there
should be any changes in silk, galls or ginger, please let me know.

Please hand the enclosed, undamaged, to Mr Samuel la Motte and procure an answer. I
have been asked to obtain it by my friends in Germany and beg you to forgive the trouble.

you and refer you to what I said in my previous letter. I firmly believe that there could be
something to be done with goods from [England] if only sales were somewhat greater than
they have been because of all the miserable unrest in Germany. To all appearances things may
soon improve because the peace has been largely settled and there is good hope that God will
grant the remainder. We may then look about for something profitable to invest in. Ardasse,
if it is choice quality, can fetch 14 to 14 1/2s; poor quality can be had for 13 to 13 1/2s. Oil remains
at the same price still and is selling for RD 80 per pipe, since there is little in town. Indigo
guatemalo is at 6s. There are few raisins to be obtained, and I refer you for the rest to the

a convoy, in time for him to get there from here. He would be glad to see if there was one
about the middle of June. I await to hear what there is.

Further, I must ask you, as a friend, to send me with the earliest ship 400 glass bottles and
500 or 600 cork plugs to close them with as I understand that they are very much cheaper and
better than here. I have had some Champagne wine sent to me from France and it can be

very bad. May God forgive Urban Hall ifhe is the cause of it. I hope that before long he will
at last pay me what he owes.

I see also that you have sold 300 copper blanks, for which I am glad. I have set the proceeds
of £81 3s 4d down to your account. Business in this country is still very bad, particularly
because we have had a long, dry winter, which still continues. This spring we have had hardly
any rain and the sea has been frozen from the continued cold, which means that all iron and
copper works have been at a standstill for lack of water. I am sure that not half as much iron
has been worked this year as at other times in the past. I have been waiting all spring for
1.000-1.200 slb of iron to come down with the first barge, but so far have had no more than
600 slb, and that is on account of the shortage of water. Although I would wish you to have
2.000 slb it will be rather slow to go now. Likewise, I also have 100 slb of copper at Nyköping
and 200 slb at Norrköping, which I have ordered to be made into copper-wire, but because of
the lack of water it is also delayed for a long time. Meanwhile, there is an English ship lying at
Norrköping which will be leaving soon and I shall load on it, consigned to you, as much as is now ready. Otherwise there is nothing special to report and I refer you to my previous letters,

Hendrick Cletcher handed over to me on the 13th instant a letter of yours, dated the 16th of
May, together with a bill of exchange for RD 2.100 drawn on His Excellency Erick Fleming,
with orders about what to do if it were not paid. Mr Cletcher gave me the letter because he
was about to set off on his journey to his works, as you can see from the accompanying letter
from him, to which I refer you. You can be assured that I shall serve you promptly and
reasonably. Concerning the bill of exchange, I tried to show it to the acceptant but as he died
some weeks ago in the country and as his wife is still there I have had to let the widow know
about the bill by letter and, if she is willing to accept the same, have asked her to let one of her
friends write to me and assure me that the bill would be promptly paid. If the acceptant asks
me to send the bill of exchange I cannot decide whether or not to send the original into the
country, but I am keeping to the letter he wrote to me and as long as it is accepted there
should be no difficulty. These people want to make it good and I do not doubt that it will be
promptly honoured as the widow wants her son to maintain his credit, of which they stand in
need. Herewith goes a letter to him which I beg you to forward as soon as possible. He writes
that he will pay me in cash. If so I shall await your orders, being at your command at any
hour, for at the present there is no chance of remitting to London or Hamburg or Amsterdam
at a rate of 24 dollars per £1 sterling, as no one wants to do it on London for less than
27 dollars, nor Hamburg for 26 marks and Amsterdam for 25 marks, so there is nothing to be
done, and I can see no prospect of improvement.

Iron is at 29 or 30 dollars, according to quality, and one can get good iron for 30 dollars and
very fine iron for 31 dollars. There is little sign ofany change. Wire is at 280 to 282 dollars and
it is thought that it might perhaps rise higher since not so much is being made as last year.
There is no pitch or tar for sale as the Company itself has none here to load its own ships with,
though things may be better in the summer when moreis likely to come in. If you could send
a ship with malt, which now fetches 16 dollars per ton and looks very likely to fetch more by
August, and take a return cargo of tar and some wire and iron, you would not do badly.

Whatever your order, you can rest assured that it will be promptly attended to as soon as it
comes, If there are any other matters in which I can be of service you have only to command.
I handle the affairs of Steven de Geer and David van Baerle, who assure me that they are well satisfied, and I am sure you will likewise find it so. For the present there is nothing more

brings him in safety I shall take possession of the same and put them in a good place in the
warehouse and meanwhile await your orders, for you will have seen from my foregoing
letter that I have left the proffered galls for your account, and there they can remain. My
intention, when I gave the order, was to have some if there was any considerable rise in prices
being maintained. You will by now have cancelled my order, and I am meanwhile waiting to
hear what you want to have done with them, and whether you wish them to be bought by
me. You can rest assured that your interests will be safeguarded as if they were my own, and
that you will find me punctual and prompt in everything, in order to encourage you to
entrust me with further commands, I trust that the opportunity will present itself so that we
can have more dealings with one another. May God only grant that business will improve! At
present there is little demand for galls and things are rather quiet, but I hope that before long
things will go better. Meanwhile, the Leipzigers have come, who usually buy a good
quantity. I have been now and again offered 47 ML per 100 lb., with 13 months rebate, for a
quantity of mine, but I have not wanted to sell them since you persuaded me that they would
not decline in price. Now, others are selling good quality stuff at 46 1/2 ML per 100 lb., but I
hope that they will pick up again as soon as there is more demand. This will be governed by
the quantity coming from [England], which will be known to you, and if the price is
reasonably firm I shall either keep them or dispose of them.

I see that pepper has risen in price in [London]. It remains here at 12 3/4g per lb., but may
well be influenced by that. I still have mine all together in hand, which at first were selling ata
loss for 12g. Raisins have been greatly sought after. Please learn what can be expected from
[England]. Good quality should sell in handfuls for 30 to 31 ML per 100 lb. If you can send
any please do so freely, vizt. choice quality, if you can haggle for it at 12s per lb. Oil and many
other Marseille goods are falling; only capers have newly arrived and are selling in handfuls at

God bring him and also Thomas Master in safety as he has with Charles Siers. I have received
the ginger which he brought and found the quality reasonably good, so there is no further
need to discuss it.

I am surprised that many goods are dearer in [England] than here. It seems the English do
not want to sell in [London] at a reasonable price but would rather send them here and take
less for them than they can get in [England]. This is bad business, but as it seems irremediable
one must simply be patient.

I would have very gladly had some cotton, and I regret that you have been so slow about
purchasing it. It is now too dear and the exchange too high for it to come. Enclosed I send a
second bill of exchange for £100 at double usance on Mr William Gore, payable to my
order. Please procure its acceptance and keep it by you until further order.

You have bought for my account about 4.000 lb. of Bermuda tobacco at 5d [per lb.] on the
condition that you paid for the barrels and the costs of packing. Put that down to me,
although I fear that the expenses will be very great and may easily amount to 4d [per lb.], as
the subsequent account will probably show. If you cannot achieve anything with regard to
the commission for Barbados indigo please buy about 50 sacks of white, scraped ginger at 30s
[per cwt.], but the quality must be as fine as the last lot, otherwise it is no use to me. Please
despatch it as quickly as possible, and let me know if you succeed. And if you can obtain good
Barbados sugar at 21 1/2 —21 3/4 shillings, free on board, please buy me 10 or 12 butts and send
them here. You can draw on me for the cost at double usance, as advantageously as possible,
and your bills of exchange will be duly honoured.

The English earth(1) about which I have written to you before is a kind which is used by the
silk-weavers if they want to weave the silk in a hard colour—that is to say, not liable to wash
off—which, by the action of the earth becomes suppler, since it contains a secret which is
unknown to most people, and those that know it will not reveal it to others. I would like you
to ask for such an earth from a weaver, but do not let it appear that it is to be used for weaving for then he could see what kind it is and learn its use. If you can get it you would do me a
friendly service, and if there is anything in which I can serve you please command me freely,

Iconfirm my order about buying for me 25 bales of pepper, and I must now wait to hear at

34s 11g for which you have been credited with 2.618.12 ML. The said amount is remitted for

I have just now seen in a letter to Mr Ruland the prices which have been set by the [English
East India] Company on one commodity and another, I greatly wish I might have known
this eight days earlier so that I could have rushed off an order, since not much cardamon was
sold. Ihad imagined that the price would have been higher, but 3s per lb. is quite reasonable.
I wish I had commissioned it together with my preceding order, but if the Company has not
raised it much higher than it is now, and if you can obtain it in one way or another so that it
will yield a little profit, I would gladly have 500 to 600 lb. I should also be glad to have ro or
15 pots of preserved ginger, as a trial, at the least price obtainable. But please buy nothing
other than good quality and look after my interests as if they were your own. For your
reimbursement please draw the total on me for payment at the beginning of next month and
your bills will be punctually honoured. I could have remitted to you today for 35s, at sight,

find just one buyer for your galls. If he would take the whole batch I would be glad to lower
the price. One must wait for an opportunity, and I shall allow no chance to slip by. You can

have likewise been informed in time by my agents about what ships it has been loaded in. I
shall now wait and see how much there will be for the coming year and take care that the

I now have before me your letter of July the 11th. Cletscher is not here but is expected
soon and we shall then discuss your affairs. Young Momma is here, telling everyone of the
wrong you do them. The only thing I had to say is that the objections to paying were quite

The exchange on Amsterdam is high here, at about 26 dollars, et fort peu de bonne lettres.

There is not much iron in stock: all the works are at a standstill for lack of water and abroad
there are no sales. The English come here with salt to lade tar. There is little pitch and now
little tar also, but more is likely to come. Botte aura fait un movais coup. Without the pitch
we would have difficulty in finding the running capital, in my opinion. Mr Wouters? has
bought for you a quantity of ‘O’ iron at 31 dollars and given 32 for 'L'. This is to make up
for the exchange rate. There are now four English ships here which will have difficulty in
obtaining any freight or cargo if no tar arrives, because there is not as much iron in town as
they need for their lading.

Voyla la pais conclus entre les Rois du Nort! I hope that matters will now go rather better.

La sell se vent a 13 1/2 dollars now, and ifan English ship had not arrived with some it would
have risen. There is still one more expected, et puis les vesseaux holandois are somewhat
delayed, it may well rise again.

There is little copper in stock. It has all been coined and stands at 290 dollars. Wire can be
got at 270 to 272 dollars.

2 After two years without any arrivals of Japanese copper, 1679 saw the import by the Dutch East India
Company of some 7.919 cwt.","Your welcome letter of the 19th/29th past was safely received and the enclosed letters for
Stockholm and Gothenburg have been forwarded today, since—for your information—the
post always leaves here on Tuesday and Saturday.(1)

You now order that £200 sterling should be laid out on presillas, instead of £100. The
amount which was to be had for £100 has already been ordered. I have never despatched any
Brabant goods by way of Dunkirk before but if the costs are more reasonable than they are
from here I shall see to it. This is a free port for the export of Brabant goods, so the duty only
has to be paid on export from Brabant and on import here. There is going to be a convoy
departing from here for Bilbao between the 20th and asth of this month, and I believe in
Middelburg I shall have the best opportunity of handling things for you as if for myself.

I have procured acceptance of your four bills of exchange and I shall keep them by me as
you ordered, awaiting your commands for our East India Company sale. No one knows
when it will be but one of our returning ships is now in harbour and the enclosed will tell you
more fully about the cargo, for your consideration. An unusually large amount of copper is
coming from Japan, as a result of which copper has fallen considerably here. There is also a
great quantity of silk.

I confirm again that you, or others, would do very well to remit now any money that is
needed over here, now your Company has had its sale, for the frenzy of drafts will lower the
exchange rate. Money will be needed when we have our sale and there is likely to be plenty of
money coming to [London] from Cadiz, which should also find its way here. I have no doubt
that anyone who understands your trade will know how to extract some profit from this.

There is much going to Sweden. If there is anything here which might be useful to you, or
any goods which can be brought from there, any purchase of cloths or otherwise, be pleased
to command, I intend you to take satisfaction in my management, and you can easily
experiment with a small trial-order. But as regards salt, a great deal has been sent from these
parts. The ships are chartered for St Ubes and from there go direct to Sweden.
While writing this I have received letters from Ghent saying that linen has risen but in
three or four weeks will fall again. Meanwhile my friend will risk finding out what can be

done.

letter of the 11th of July which reached me yesterday together with various enclosures which
have all been duly forwarded. I gave De Geer his personally.

You will have learned from my previous letter that I have received the RD 2.100. I now
see your order about how you want it employed. No one knows how the exchange goes,
according to Mr Jacob Fahlgreen, or whether it will continue. It is just not possible to remit
good bills of exchange for [London] at the moment for 25 dollars, or to Hamburg, or to
Amsterdam. The reason is that bills on London can fetch 28 dollars, on Hamburg 26 1/4 to 1/2,
and on Amsterdam 25 1/2 to 26 marks, so there is nothing to be done.

It is difficult to spend anything on pitch or tar. There is scarcely any pitch and little tar in
stock, so that whoever takes it gets bad stuff for 130 dollars. I hear that it scarcely fetches £7
in [London], so that also must be passed over. As for orgronts iron, such as ‘OO’ or 'G',
the latter is not obtainable but I have ordered as much of the ‘OO’ as your funds here with me
extend to for 31 dollars, which the other English here would have gladly taken but I obtained
the preference. ‘G’ is to be had, but not for less than 32 dollars. It is in Claes Wilkens’s hands
and he has sold it to various Englishmen at 32 dollars, so I hope you will be content with this
amount. About 200 slb will be shipped tomorrow morning with Captain William Norham,
an Englishman, for [London]. I have agreed the freight at £2, or forty shillings, per last. I
shall consign it to you and give orders to Jan van Deurs at the Sound that he draws the Sound
toll on you. This serves to inform you in case you find it necessary to order some insurance.

The rest of the iron is expected from the works in eight days. I shall then ship it as quickly
as possible and let you know when it is done. There is no square iron nor yet broad iron, but
some voyage iron. As soon as the bill of lading is signed it will be sent to you.

You would do well if you could send some English malt. There is none in stock here, little
is expected and a great demand is approaching. But, above all, the malt must be choice, which
I believe could easily fetch 19 or 20 dollars. You cannot fail to make a profit.",,C. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & JACOB DAVID,DUTCH,1679,23 AUGUST 1679,29 Sep. 1679,,,456,,

Because of the cheap freight-rates to [England] in free English shipping I have decided to
send you a quantity of iron for my own account, as a trial. It will consist of orgronts iron, up
to 800 slb of ordinary plate 'G' iron, and about 450 slb of schampeleon and other sorts of
Y' iron. It has been distributed and loaded in the following three ships, each with about
the same amount—in the ship called the Providence of London, of which Ralph Johnson is
captain; in the ship Industry of London, captain Henry Collins, and also in the ship named
John of Yarmouth, captain John Allen. And because they will be sailing in the autumn I dare
not take any risks, so I must ask you to be so kind as to have them insured against all risks by
good and reliable insurers, each of them for RD 2.200, which for all three ships amounts to
RD 6.600. You need have no doubts about the shipment being made, God willing, and you
have only to ask Mr Urban Hall and other friends who used to live here about me to be
satisfactorily informed. The freight rate has been agreed at 30 shillings per last of 15
shippounds, and in the bill of lading it has been stated that it has been shipped by me for your
account and risk, so will you please write accordingly to Jean van Deurs at Elsinore in order
that he can lay out the toll-money for you and draw it on you. If the dear Lord will give us a
secure peace I will send you a good quantity each year, provided that I find it worth my
while. For I must be served by you on reasonable terms, in controlling the expenses and
taking care to whom you sell, though I cannot tie you down to any fixed price. I also hope
you will be satisfied with a 1 1/2 per cent commission and an allowance of 4 per cent on any
advance of money you may make on receipt of the bills of lading. In your reply I shall expect
to learn how much you will permit me to draw on you from Hamburg, and please mention
in it what your friend is called and commend to him the honour of my bills of exchange. If
you insist on asking for a higher rate of interest I shall have to submit to it patiently until the
goods are sold, although the bad prices which I am advised there are in [England] will not
bear any high interest charges.

If there is still a lot of pitch and tar for Mr Botte’s account lying on your hands unsold,
please keep me informed about it, because I also have some interest in it. But do not mention
it to him or let him know that I have sent you any goods on my account. He has no share in it.

The news is that there is no tar nor pitch here in town, and the English ships lying here are
unable to get any, which is the reason why they have to take the iron for such a cheap freight.
One cannot expect any tar before the month of October, but iron is fetching reasonably good prices here. With friendly regards, &c.

[P.S.] If in the coming year, you would like to contract for the pitch and tar coming to
England so that it can all be held in one hand I shall be glad to help you in preference to others,
but it is necessary that you have a capable man of English nationality living here who can
defend the contract for you against the resident English, and when you have a ship here he can
run along to the authorities and obtain permission for it to export something in one way or
another. A last of tar, of 13 barrels, is 130 copper dollars free on board, which according to the
current rate of exchange is about 20 to 21 rixdollars; and a last of pitch, of 12 barrels per last,
can be had for 212 dollars, or 33 to 34 rixdollars, according to the rate of exchange, which
may serve to inform you. Adieu.",,C. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & JACOB DAVID,GERMAN,1679,9 SEPTEMBER 1679,3 Oct. 1679,7 Oct. 1679,,730,"[P.S.] If in the coming year, you would like to contract for the pitch and tar coming to

7 1/2 barrels of our tobacco for 5s, payable in cash, to Jean Cordes. This I now confirm.

Since then I have heard nothing from you although I long to do so, so that I can see the
account of what was loaded in Thomas Hill in order to know what it involves. Now and
again, instead of receiving your letters by way of Amsterdam, I occasionally get them by way
of Antwerp and they sometimes arrive one post late, which is inconvenient. Please always
send them by way of Amsterdam.

In my preceding letter I ordered you not to buy anything more for my account. This I
now confirm. Although I am not greatly afraid of any trouble we may get from the King of
Denmark, it has nonetheless caused business to worsen here, and apart from that the exchange
is so extravagant that I am not willing to have any drafts. You will oblige me if you can
recover what you have disbursed for me from the remittances and I will provide you with an
appropriate rate of interest as long as this damaging rate of exchange continues.

I have been unable to achieve anything in the sale of our remaining bale of Ardasse, nor
likewise with our Bermuda tobacco. Since I fear that things will go badly for this commodity
I am going to barter it for Jawers linen, if any opportunity offers, and send it to [England],
which I hope you will not oppose. I shall inform you if I have any success.

I await news of Hill’s departure. John Bates arrived here in a very few days from England.
May God also guide him in safety.

German to give him some practice. Apart from that, the King of Denmark has requested

city. It is thought that His Majesty will outline his demands. Meanwhile, the city is provided

2 A reference to Jane Marescoe and John Lewknor.","My last letter was on the [blank], since which I have heard nothing from you. Nevertheless, I
am writing to tell you how things stand with the Mommas. The old man is at Nyköping and
the young man is here, but there is nothing to be done with them. They are stiff-necked and
refuse to listen to reason. The one living here is usually drunk everyday from the morning
onwards. Enfin, in my opinion, if one proceeds against them one will be only throwing good
money after bad.

I shall see if something can be arranged with Mr Cletscher about the interested parties, but
it will not be easy. Also a salt licence will first have to be obtained. This gentleman is no
commission-agent and he concerns himself only with his own affairs, au reste, honnete
homme.

I long to get your letters and my wine, which is taking a long time. Otherwise it will be
too late, for we shall be in the depths of winter before the two voyages can reach the inland
sea. At the earliest opportunity please let me know your opinion about the pan iron and how
much one might have made for the coming year. I shall give orders for the rough ends to be
cut off and, to make it lighter, I shall make use of the old pig-iron which is very good. Send
me a note about it, because they have asked to know how much they should make of each
sort.

There is also some 'G' iron available which turns out a little harder than the other sort,
and as it comes from good iron we use it here for hooping heavy wheels as we find it stronger
and more durable than the other kind. If I knew the breadth which is most often required in
England for binding wagon-wheels I would have one or two sorts made as an experiment.
Please send me a note about it, but leave the memorandum open so that Westhuysen(1) can
send me a duplicate.

Overseas iron prices are low, and over here most works have made only two-thirds of the
amount they made last year because of the lack of water. As a result, I cannot send you any
ordinary ‘G’ sheet-iron, though I hope it will be possible to do so next year. Let me also know
about ‘OO’ iron and how suitable it is, as well as the 'L' of which Mr Wilkens has sent you
a quantity this year. Also, let me know if the ‘OO’ square-iron should be of 1 inch, 1 1/8 inch
and 1 1/4 inch as well as 1 1/2 inches, and how much of each sort would be best.

As I am afraid that the ships which are now lying here loading up may not get away in
time, and as I have to make some payments at Amsterdam in December, I shall have to ask
you to accommodate me with three or four hundred pounds which Westhuysen could draw
upon you for me, or else you could remit it to him. I shall be glad if it can be done, but please
let Amsterdam know how it would suit you best. It will only be for a little while and
Westhuysen will let you know whether he will need it in December or February.

I had written as far as this when your letter of the 26th of September arrived. I see that the
ships have come and note the amount of pan iron that is required for next year. I shall have it
made, in the same assortment as before, and will make sure that it is done properly in order to
encourage the customers, though in your last letter you wrote that I was not to make the
thickest sort or, at least, not as they were now made because the ends were not even, but I
should now be able to supply them.

If I pass through Nyköping I shall see if I can speak with the elder Momma. The dispute is
making no progress, et doit plus qu’il n’a de bien.

Iron seems to be very dear here, but the exchange on Amsterdam is reckoned at 26 marks
per dollar, and as the return freight-rates to London are not dear this year it has been possible
to send it.

Concerning copper-wire, I have told Mr Wouters to inform you how things stand as he is
best acquanited with it. I cannot judge whether one can deal safely with him. Pour moy je na
fay difficulte de lesser de mes effaits entre ces mains et je le trouve vigilent et qu'il pren bien

Consolidated Treaty Series, XV, pp. 351-4.","Today is the rst of November and the above, of the 8th of September, is a copy of my last
letter. I am sure that it has reached you safely as well as the despatched 235 slb [of iron] since
the ship passed through the Sound a long while ago. For the rest, I refer you to my letter.

Since then I have received your letters of the 5th and 19th of September, which I should
have answered earlier but I have been hoping every day that the iron would arrive and that I
would be able to send you the bill of lading. I am extremely annoyed that it is taking so long
and my Lord De Geer can be my witness that it is no fault of mine, as the wind has always
been so contrary that nothing has been able to come from the works. For six weeks [the iron]
has been lying in the barge, somewhere between the works and this city. Secondly, letters
have been held up. We have been hoping every week that the posts would go again since
peace was concluded, but they have been held back until now, so that it is only with this post
that one can make a start with the correspondence, since the normal post is leaving.

In my last letter I wrote to you that I had debited you 8.293 dollars and 15 öre for the
235 slb of iron, but in making a record of it I find that I have made an error amounting to I
dollar 16 6re copper money. In reckoning the Slb. 235.13 of iron @ 31 dollars I had put it
down as 7.303 dollars 20 dre, but the total ought really to be 7.305 and 4 6re, so that your net
debit on the account of iron stands at 8.294 dollars and 31 öre, which you will please note and
forgive the mistake.

Herewith is the bill of lading for the remaining quantity of Slb. 162.4.10 lb. of iron
despatched to you aboard Captain Hans Kroger. I have procured a somewhat lower freight-
rate, but it will have to pay rather more toll since the ship is entirely without a free pass. It can
be bought for half dollar or something, so your iron is not too heavily burdened, and I will
take care of it as if it were for myself. The last one, in which the 235 slb was shipped, had
partial freedom and I paid for the rest so that it got total freedom, but this ship has absolutely
no freedom so something must be paid which we recover through the freight-rate, as we
have cheaper freight than before. When the duty is paid an account will be sent to you. The
shipment will be ready to depart in a few days. He is mostly loaded with tar for the owner’s
account.

Hendrick Cletcher has transferred to me your power of attorney and other documents
concerning Willem Momma at Nyköping and asked me to pursue the matter so that it can be
brought to a conclusion. He further says that you gave him instructions to make me such a
request. In fact, you have written nothing to me about it, and it is also a very troublesome
commission which looks like being a thankless task, but out of regard for you and at the
persuasion of Mr Cletcher and also of De Geer I have undertaken it and had your power of
attorney translated into German and have served it on him, requiring him to answer to me
about the account. The son, Isaac Momma, who is here, has answered me in place of his
father, who is in Nyköping. He says he will send the copy of the power of attorney to his
father and let me know the answer. He was sure that his father would not allow him to come
to any agreement or compromise until, or before, you debited him in his father’s account
with the RD 2.000 which you once wrote (to the said Momma) that you had paid to De
Geer, but he would let me know his father’s answer. Steven de Geer has refuted all this to
him, but it seems that there is little happening, so it is now necessary to learn from you what
you want ordered to be done about it if he will not agree to reason, and how much you will
allow me to deduct from the account, or what else you will concede. I beg you to let me
know a little about your views of the matter. I shall know how to manage things properly
and will try to do the best that is possible for you. The sooner the case is settled the better, for
at the moment there is something to be hoped for but later there may not perhaps be so
much. I look forward to learning what you have ordered and will govern myself
accordingly.

I see that the ships will be ready to depart at the earliest in mid-October, so we shall begin
to get ready for them. It is to be wished that they come soon, with salt selling at 17 dollars. I
was selling all mine at 18 dollars, but since the arrival of two Dutch ships and one English it
has been running at 17 dollars and as we are selling it daily we hope the price will continue so,
since nothing more is expected from Holland, where it is very dear and selling at £64 [flem.].
Malt, if it is good, will also fetch a lot of money since there is little English malt in stock here.
If God grants its arrival I shall take care of your interests as if they were my own, on that you
can rely.

I see that in [England] our Swedish wares are very cheap, while here they remain dear. As I
wrote previously, iron is at 31 to 32 dollars, according to its quality, and there is not much in
stock. Pitch and tar are as before. There is little tar here, though one can obtain something at
the previous price. The Company is sending nothing to Holland as there are sufficient stocks
there. Letters from Holland say that the commercial treaty between this Crown and Holland
has been concluded.(1) We have not been able to learn the main points yet, but it is not doubted
that the Company will come to an end, of which you in [England] will have earlier news than
us.

Although copper prices have dropped so much in Holland, with plenty coming from the
East Indies, it still remains dear here and is still selling at 245 dollars. On the exchange it is
260 dollars and it is the same with copper-wire which is still at 275 dollars, and none selling
for less. But the demand is also very bad and there is none to sell. Here in town there are about
200 slb in stock. A similar amount is expected but there is no one to buy it. The English have
absolutely no desire for it, and in the last two months not more than 80 slb have been sent to
[England], vizt. 70 slb in the month of September and ro slb in the month of October, which
is very little, and one hears nothing so far that any of it has been sold. If I intend to do
anything I shall let you know. Now that we have got water all the works are in full
production, but little will come oft this year. Most of the wire is sent to Holland and France, and most of it to the latter. With this I must close, with regards, &c.",,C. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & JACOB DAVID,DUTCH,1679,1 NOVEMBER 1679,20 Nov. 1679,2 Dec. 1679,,1300,,

sold another 30 tons of my iron, which is good. I wish the rest was sold. Although the price is
very low one must sell as one can, following the market. However, concerning what you
wrote previously about a quantity of the 'L' [iron] reaching you, I think you will find, as has
been found here, that the ‘O’ iron sells for 4 or 5 per cent more than the 'L'

I wrote to you previously to say that 500 slb of ‘O’ iron was selling at Stockholm and that I
presumed it would be sent to London, but I am now informed in letters of the 8th of
November that the English only bought 200 slb and the rest is being sent to Hamburg.

You will please deal with my iron as if it were for yourself. I have ordered the square ‘O’
iron to be made so that it can be sent to you in the spring, as it was before, but as for the sheet
iron of 3 1/4 and 3 1/2 inches thick I have not ordered it because it would be too thick, and thus
unsaleable. Instead I have ordered them to make the sheets of the usual breadths but as light as
possible. However, in reply please send me a paper showing the thickness and breadth [you
require] so that I can judge whether it can be made, for I have been an iron-master for over 54
years.

Regarding the voyage iron for Genoa—we get it made inland, from Luxemburg and
Germany and could easily deliver it here to the agent for 76 and 78 guilders per ton, in a large
quantity. I have before now delivered 20.000 to 25.000 bars in one year, but I must get £15 1/2 to £16 [sterling] for it. Farewell. “",,C. LETTERS TO LEONORA MARESCOE & JACOB DAVID,DUTCH,1679,12 DECEMBER 1679,6 Dec. 1679,6 Dec. 1679,,321,,

mislike the account. I should be very glad to have you and Mr Christopher Lethieullier come
in shares togather; neverthelesse if that cannot be yet my dilligence shall not be wanting in

revive for most of the goods that came per last ships were immediately bought up and now
this year the flotta is to goe and we expect likewise the gallioons may goe in October next.
Goods must of necessity be in demand all the year long, so you may the more boldly venture
upon goods. We have advice from Tangier that the moors attackt that place with a numerous
army and blew up 5 small forts that the English diserted. The vice-admiral being then there
he landed near 400 men for their assistance with whom they sallied out and beat the Moores
from their trenches. They are retreated from the towne at present. Likewise from Gibraltar
we have advice that the Hampshire friggat had retaken an English Newfoundlandman with 10 Moors in her. Here is nothing elce of novelty at present, so with salutefull respects I crave

better businesse. Wax beeing so cheape in London, here’s a good quantitie come. I suppose

you finde it comes cheaper thence then it can be had in England. Of the barragans I have sould

about 1/2 and shall putt of the rest by all occasions. Mr Duquesnoy writes me they are fallen at
Vallencia, but I observe the exchange is also lower for London which may make them as
deare to you. If you find it otherwyse and that the pryse is considerably lower that they may
be sent with more conveniency, they are a sound comodity, but pray order him to keep to
their goodnesse for others send better goods. All goods there as well as in England are
generally provyded on better tearmes in the winter, and the spring here I find the best time
for sale. Hose of Tournoy are here a current comodity and many sell. I cannot tell what
account they may produce, haveing never sould any. He is acquanted with the sort propper,
and I have sent Sir John a muster of picotes, which he hath sent Duquesnoy. Is a comodity
hath good vent here, if they can be had at about 12 reals per piece, as they might lately; also
pelos de camelo, the broader sort, which are worth here 4 1/2 to 5 R. pta. per vare as in goodnesse,

risen at home to 22d per ell. Its not impossible but they may keepe up, the flota goeing for the

deare if they should fall and be brought cheaper, but if they fall not at home I am perswaded
they will ryse proportionable here, as they have donne for some monethes and seaverall
accounts I have lately sent home of them have yealded well. Here are moreover few in towne,

other goods which ly by long and sell to worse paymasters, as pressillias whereof I have some

2 Johan Utterclo, ‘assessor’ in the Swedish Kommerskollegium and an important figure in the direction of the
Tar Company.","I found myself honoured three days ago with your very welcome letter of the 5th instant,
together with three bills of exchange totalling £400 drawn on Mr William Smitt, of which I
have procured acceptance, and with God’s help I do not doubt I shall get due payment.

You have now ordered that, if the money has been paid, I should lay it out this winter on
some good sorts of iron from reliable people. In reply, I must say in a friendly way that I
cannot exactly follow your order for the reason that the money only falls due at the end of
January and February, and then there is no iron to be obtained; and if there is any to be
obtained now it must be by means of money—but that is not due yet. Now, for the space ofa
week or a fortnight, is a rest-period when those with money travel up-country to provide the
works with everything they need, such as coal and ore which is used in the making of iron.
However, as it is up to me to take care of your interests so that your money is not lying idle,
and in order that you should profit from the low price of iron, I sent to a person two days ago,
who was on the point of selling to another but gave me preference, and agreed with him for
400 slb of iron, of which 200 slb will be ordinary sheet-iron, 100 slb broad, schampelion iron
and 100 slb square iron, to deliver here in Stockholm with the first open water at 27 dollars
[per slb]. He takes over the bills of exchange and will discount them or negotiate them as best
he can, though I remain liable for any failure of payment.

The iron is of good material which has been always sent, year after year, to one Mr
Strodder(1) in England. The works once belonged to Utterclo(2) and its mark is ‘XX’ but the
works have now been sold to another and it is with him that I have contracted, and I am
assured that we will be well treated. Mr Strodder, the English merchant, gave 30 dollars for
iron last year. There are 200 slb lying ready at the works which I can have immediately. But it
is a pity that you did not write how broad the schampelion should be. It has been ordered in
various breadths. Please let me know at once in answer to this so it can reach me in time.

I have no doubt that you will be well satisfied with this business, but orgronds iron was not
to be obtained. For the 400 slb at 27 dollars you owe me 10.800 dollars, against which we can
set the bills of exchange unless their payment fails, which I trust it will not. If it should please
you to place this order as it suits you (for this consignment will not be disadvantageous for
you) I shall be able to help you with further amounts. You can be assured of my promptitude and reliability and that I will take care of your interests as if they were my own. God protect
you, &c.","Hamburg: 27 1/2 to 28.

12th of September and of the 4th and 25th of November last year. Until now I have deferred

my answer because this city has been troubled by war concerning some differences between

the Elector of Brandenburg and the King of Denmark, but they were all settled some weeks

ago. After that, winter descended and although we have had little frost and the waters remain

navigable the damaging west wind has lasted for three weeks and has gathered a great

number of ships here. There are at least 350, large vessels as well as small, among which are

100 laden with oats destined for France, but the west wind keeps them all in, which is very
vexing. However, since they will be going in the spring we must hope for an improvement in
our lives and that trade will go rather more briskly. Meanwhile, thank you for the prices of
sundry goods as well as your opinions on one thing or another. I beg you to continue sending
them occasionally as well as news ifany changes occur in the following commodities, such as
silk, pepper, ginger and gall-nuts. I might well ask for some of the latter if fine quality can be
obtained and the price is not too high. I await your opinion on the matter.

The ship of which you were thinking, which came here ‘adritura’ with 200 sacks, brought
only poor, small stuff which will not sell. Two or four sacks were sold for about 43 ML [per
100 lb.] but good quality can fetch as much as 46 or 47 ML. Ardasse silk sells for 13s with the
customary rebate; pepper, 13 3/4g; white, scraped ginger, 7g; ditto, black or brown ginger, 4 1/2
to 4 5/8 or 4 3/4g, and so far there is for all commodities very poor sales.

It is a good thing that you received from Mr James Banks the £134 11s 10d remitted and
made good the proceeds to Mr John Wigget. I have so far had no letter of news from him, but since it concerns him or his friend Edmont Waaff I suppose it is not necessary. With very

at 54 2/5g on Antonio Gomez Serra and negotiated here with Philip Verporten.
Since then I have received your welcome letter of the 20th instant, and with it your
extensive news of what has been happening to one commodity or another in [London]. Since
goods there are nearly all dearer than here it seems that the trade between here and there must
perish, for over there they are maintained at high prices and are sent over here by the owners
but as soon as they arrive they are sold for what they will fetch, which is ruining trade.
Barbary almonds are sold here thus, which because they can be freely brought to [London]
can be profitably sent here at 40s. Silk is also sold here for poor prices, so that I cannot make
up my mind to invest 9s [per lb.] for them in [London]. It will have to wait until next May,
when probably quite enough will arrive. I do not believe that the currants which have been
sent here will do very well, for a good quantity are expected to come here addrittura.

That the East India Company is holding a sale on the 9th of March I have noted, and when
I receive the details I shall at once consider them and if I decide on any purchases I shall let you
know. Sugars have little demand here at present and I cannot decide on enlarging my price
limit. I have also seen letters from others in which they advise that good quality [sugar] could
be had for 20s or 20s 6d, free on board. Please see if you could not obtain some for less from
someone in need of cash, though it must be of good quality, otherwise my balance may as
well as lie in London.

Enclosed herewith I am sending a note about the weights of the 10 hogsheads of Jamaican
sugar. Please show it to the man who sold them to youso that he can see what is lacking. The
weights are only of the casks, from which 3/4 per cent was deducted here, and a hundred-
weight in [England] must yield 104 lb. here. Captain Lomax brought all his crew ashore in
order to take oath, but I did not want that since I would then have had to pay all the expenses
here, and I did not know if I could obtain anything in [London]. Now Lomax is no longer
here and it is too late for his people to swear. Since you still have the seller in hand he will have
to be satisfied with the note, though ifhe will not believe honourable people I shall send him a
notarial deed, provided that he pays the expenses. If, in addition, I could send you the
testimony of the crew it would already have been sent to you. I urge you to take care of my
interests as if they were your own.

Enclosed I send you the account of the remaining Bermuda tobacco, of which your
promised half is £69 8s og, for which I shall give you credit if the money is paid in. Please
check the account, and if you find no mistakes, please make a record of it. I also remit you
herewith, for your account, £100 at double usance in a bill of Jan & H. Louis drawn on
Pickering & Robinson. Please procure the necessary and credit me with £171 13s 4g at

five weeks ago to my leg, which was broken clean through just above the ankle, though
now—God be thanked —it has improved so much that I am beginning to get up and I hope
within a fortnight to be completely recovered, without any impediment.

This has prevented the journey which I was planning to take to Nyköping, so I have been
unable to do anything about your suit with Momma. With Mr Cletscher things stand as
before, for he will not waive any of the interest since the debt is too great, though about the
salt-licence he is not doing much good. There too there is some good reason for it, but it has
been caused by his own fault. I have told him it is cheap, and as soon as the repayment comes
in from others I shall settle it in order to close the account.

I am glad that the pan-iron was found to be so good. That which is now being made will
be done in the same way, and the coarseness removed from it.

It is not feasible to make the 3-inch sheet-iron only 1/4-inch thick. It would bend about, for
even the smallest iron cannot be made 1/4-inch thick, but I shall have it forged as thin as
possible. Let me know at once if more will be paid for it than for the ‘OO’ or the 'L', for it
must sell for more, otherwise it will have to be sent to Amsterdam, though as an experiment I
shall send you some.

It must have slipped my memory, but according to my calculations I should still have a
balance of about £300 with you if the proceeds of the last lot of pan-iron and the total on the
Thomazine have been paid up, unless I have made a mistake. You can expect more pan-iron
and other iron as soon as we have open waters.

Let me know at once what ships you have chartered to go to St Ubes and then come here,
and at what price, and when you estimate they can arrive here. Also, whether many grain
ships are going to the Straits this autumn from your area. In these regions we are having a
pretty tolerable winter, not very severe, and all the rivers are flowing so supplies are readily
obtainable. I shall be glad to know if iron has been enjoying some sales with you and what
you think about it. The high rate of exchange will remain as it was last year and all the
principal iron-works have made contracts accordingly.

It would have been a good thing if I had know that you were favourably inclined towards
one or other of the works apart from the 'L'. There were about 4.000 to 5.000 slb made this
year and they were mostly shared, one half to London and the other half to Amsterdam. It is
now much too late, but otherwise I should certainly have despatched some. One now draws

m-d_477,477,JACOB DE GREVE to JD,562,JACOB DE GREVE,JD,"With cordial regards, I remain, &c.",HAMBURG,HAMBURG 3 FEBRUARY 1680,,"This serves only to say that for some time I have had one case of Jauwers linen and one case of
Sloyers in the hands of Mr James Bancks in [London] which he says he cannot sell. I think that
is strange, seeing that linen is daily rising in price here. From time to time I sell plenty of the
same sort to the English here who send it to [England] themselves and do well with it. So I
suspect that, because the said James Bancks and his brother John Bancks especially trade
actively in linen themselves and because they know that I have as good an opportunity to do
so as they, they do not want to serve me with regard to linen and by not being able to sell any
hope to make me decide not to send any more to England so that I will no longer be any
obstacle to them. I wrote to him to this effect, since I saw that he could not sell any, and said
that I had the opportunity to sell them to a friend here over a year ago, to which he replied
that he would be delighted to transfer them to whomsoever I might order.

Thus (in order not to invite any jealousy that the transfer might occasion, since James
Bancks in [London] and Charles Bancks over here are my good friends) I have today drawn
up a deed of assignment that the said two cases are to be transferred at the order of my brother
[-in-law] Jean Baptista d’Hertogh, and this has been endorsed by him to you pro forma. It
comes herewith. So I ask you to send this assignment to Mr James Bancks and demand the
aforesaid two cases to be transferred on presentation of my assignment, mentioning nothing
more than that you are doing this on the orders of my brother [-in-law] Jean Baptista, and
that it is for his account. By doing this you will oblige me greatly, and if you will sell the said
Jauwers and Sloyers to my greatest advantage, either for cash or to people without liabilities,
and if the experiment succeeds I shall keep you always supplied with these and other sorts of
linen suitable for [England].

You do not have to pay Mr Bancks any charges or anything else for them since I have
written to him that I will make it good to his brother Charles here. In order to know that they
really are my cases they should, in addition to my usual mark in black on the lid, be marked
with a red mark thus, 'Z'. The case of linen [Jauwers] is also marked ‘No. 5’ and the case of
Sloyers 'F'. Perhaps, through standing around so long, the paper wrapping on the Jauwers
and Sloyers have become rather unsightly and soiled, so please take off some layers and put
fresh pieces on top which you can let the buyers see first, and then let me know what they can
sell for.

The dry weather continues and we may well have a short winter and be able to commence
the sailing season somewhat earlier. Your advice to my sister Mahuis about prices will be
useful for my consideration so that if the peace holds and the clouds of war pass by we can make a trial of something or other. May the Almighty protect you. With cordial regards, I

principal dealers in most kinds of commodities, both in London and here, have their own

loss of all but 4 or 5 men.
3 On 5 December Buck & Marescoe gave more precise specifications. The square iron was to be 1 inch thick,
the broad flat-iron was to yield 6 bars per slb (i.e. 50 lb. a-piece) and be exactly 3 inches thick; the 1.000 slb of small,

We have still had no news of the ship Noort Pool—God grant that it arrives safely!(2) It
seems to us that he is taking rather a long time, though he may have been waiting in the
Sound for other ships to have as company. We wait to hear what iron you have since loaded
for M. De la Bistrate. Please let us know if one could not have made in [Sweden] some copper
bars of about 23 feet long, weighing 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 lb., and whether or not the export duty would
amount to any more than on other wrought copper—i.e. what would it cost, free on board?
Please give us prompt advice about this, for it might be that we shall order a substantial
quantity for the spring.

We would also be glad to know, supposing we wanted to buy a substantial amount of iron
for delivery in Stockholm, how much you would have to lay out for fine, square iron—
400 slb; for broad, flat fine-iron—400 slb; and for small, thin fine-iron—1,000 slb.(3) We
believe there are iron-masters(4) who could quite casily undertake to provide such a
consignment at a reasonable price with the certainty of making a profit. Also, tell us when
their money will have to be available for payment. It would be advantageous if one could
provide the money in specie via Hamburg, but the authorities(5) will not permit it.

received your welcome letter of the 15th of November with the bill of lading for your rod-
iron and the bar-iron from M. Ant. de la Bistrate, laden in [the ship of] Hendrick Claesen,
with which we will supply ourselves. Neither he nor Adriansen have yet appeared.(1) For
some days we have had a south wind (though it is at present westerly) so we hope to hear of
them in a few days time. God bring them safely!

We have still not heard from Mr Focken about his settlement of the disagreement with the
owners of the Noot Muscatenboom(2) but Mr Jacobsen has today shown us information in his
own hand to that effect, sent to him by the captain who ordered him to take custody of the
money into his own hands and keep it until he arrives here—whereupon we informed him
that we had your order to receive your share and also Mr Radue’s. We will come to an
agreement with him and say no more about it.

If Capt. Hendrick Claesen arrives here we will advance him your one-eighth share of the
freight money, which we will make over to Caspar Bruyn together with the proceeds of
your goods sent by him aboard Capt. Adriansen.

You urge us to assist all the captains of any ships in which you have a part-interest. This we
shall do to the best of our ability, as if for ourselves, but we do not understand whether the
captains have orders from all the part-owners to address themselves to us. Meanwhile we will
extend our help to any that come to our knowledge.

You will have seen our order to procure the purchase of 2.000 slb of iron—vizt. 1/4-part
broad, 1/2 small, and 1/4 square. Please get it at the keenest price and make sure it is in good, even
and equal sizes—the square and small iron the lighter the better, of 9, 10, 11 or 12 feet long,
but the broad ought to be according to the enclosed design(3) which is of a kind that comes
from [Sweden] via Hamburg and is stamped with an ‘F’, which sells well here (if there is not
too much of it) and is of the same type that we are asking for. As for the necessary purchase
money, we have ordered you to draw at once RD 2.000 on Antoine dela Bistrate. If you have
the opportunity of doing so profitably for us you can go up to six thousand rix-dollars and
your bills will be promptly paid.

Concerning your proposal that we should accommodate you (here, as is customarily done
in Amsterdam) with money advanced upon the goods shipped here, we say that it can be
done, as long as it is not too much or too often. As you will have observed from our
preceding letter, we could easily go up to four, five or six hundred pounds per ship, but we do
not find it advisable to have the insurance done here as most of our insurers are not to our

liking. In case of a loss one has to wait, 3, 4 or 6 months, and then they deduct 15 or at least
10 per cent, as well as the premium, before they pay up. Therefore it is better to have it done
in Hamburg or Amsterdam by those friends on whom you could draw the money, ordering
them to reimburse themselves upon us. If you want the business to remain with us we shall
arrange the insurance with the rest, remaining satisfied with 1/2 per cent for any outlay. And
iron, copper or copper-wire will always sell freely, so we are in no fear of over-supplying the
market except at some times when for one or two months the market is somewhat quieter
than at other times; but that is to be expected in all places.

We have written to Caspar Bruyn today, following your order, that he may draw £200 on us; wherewith our cordial regards, &c.","Amsterdam: 35s 4g (2 usances).

received your welcome letter of 14 February and note what is happening with regard to our
commission—that the broad and square iron is being worked now—but we would hope that
you do not have to pay 26 dollars [per slb] for it, as that is much too high, all the more so in
view of the great danger it will run at sea if the Danes fall out with the Swedish Crown,
which is to be feared, so that 24 dollars would be quite enough. However, we shall rely on
your discretion to manage matters as if yourself, trusting that the iron will be evenly forged
from good material, according to our request. Speedy despatch is very important, so we urge
you to look out for Abr. Laurens or some other good skipper, and if the Sound should
become closed to your ships it would be best if you loaded everything aboard a Dutch ship
bound for Amsterdam, though the ship may come here for the decree forbidding that is not
much observed now, and the captain could give out (when he is here) that he is a Swede so
that there is no further dispute. Please give us timely advice of everything, and also to Ant. de
la Bistrate, so that we can act accordingly.

We shall send youa sample of the copper rods at the earliest Opportunity, as you requested.

the arrival of the ships from the Indies in May or June it will again fall to 73s or below. That
commodity is always bought here for cash, but as you ask for something in return for iron we could accommodate you with the outlay of the money, or draw on Amsterdam; wherewith,

2 To this point the letter is in Jacob David's hand; the next paragraph is in Marescoe’s.","My last to you was on the 4th of March, by which I advised you that I had remitted for your
account to Messrs Jean & David van Baerle £320 @ 35s 2g at 2 usances in two bills, as
follows:

Since then I have heard nothing from you, so this will serve to enclose your current account
by which a balance of £489 12s 7d remains due to me, which I have carried to your debt in a
new account, without prejudice to me for any debts which I have discounted. Below the
account is a specification of the interest placed to your debit. Please examine it and, finding it
correct, please note it and drop me a line about your findings.
Of the wire, I have sold to William Wathing 74 coils at £6 10s per cwt. payable in 6
months. I shall do my duty with the remainder and let you know what happens. Meanwhile I
am extremely sorry that it is going so sluggishly,! but one cannot do more than one’s best,
and it is commonly the case that when one has brought a commodity up to a high price the
retailers do all that they can to avoid buying anything and to discourage one, and if they do
buy anything it is only because they have no more, either to sell or work with. That is what
they are doing now, and what they buy is only in small parcels and that only when it is
absolutely necessary. However, it is my intention to keep the price up and I think I have good
reason for doing so for there is only a little in town and that is all in my hands, besides which
the prospect is that it will be two months before any more comes from [Sweden]. A person
has offered me £6 at 3 months for all which I have but I have refused him, considering it is
better to do so and maintain the price in reputation until the first consignments arrive from
[Sweden]. Thus, it is impossible to establish a new price-level unless there is an upsurge of
demand, and then I shall be selling quantities all through the week, so that before long you
can expect an account of it.

Meanwhile I would be glad to learn what amounts you intend to consign to me. You
would do well to send some copper bars as soon as possible as several ships will soon be
getting ready to sail for Guinea and this commodity will be in demand, for there is none of it
in town and large amounts will be required. Hungary plates, £6 10s; garcopper £5 185;
sheet copper £6 18s. Iron is also in request—square, broad and small iron selling at 145 6d
[per cwt.]. Gothenburg deals are very dear, selling at £6 per cwt., and others accordingly.

It has been said to me that you have agreed with our other friends in Sweden to consign all
the copper-wire (which this place can consume) to one hand, but I believe that this has not yet
been finally concluded for nothing has been written to me about it. If something like this has
been decided I beg you to make me a participant. I have always sought every opportunity to
procure your profit as if it were my own, and as the exchange has fallen so much I am very glad that I have remitted so much for your account at an advantageous price. Yours, &c.","Amsterdam: 34s 10g (2 usances).

balance of £489 12s 7d is due to me. With it I gave you news of the sale of 74 coils of copper-
wire at £6 10s per cwt. to William Wathing. Since then I have received yours of the 28th of
February from which I see that you have returned home in good health, which I am very glad
to learn. God grant that you may long remain so.

I see that you have received the sale account of the 2.357 coils of wire, found it correct and
thus made a record of it, which is good. Of the remaining copper-wire I have sold 150 coils to
Nathaniel Humphreys and others at £6 6s per cwt., which you will please make a note of. I
had thought of continuing the price at £6 10s but there is always someone who will
interfere, be it well or badly. This certain person, who has received several consignments

from [Sweden], has had 200 coils from Hamburg which, as soon as it arrived, he sent a barge

alongside to fetch the 200 coils and went selling it at £6 5s per cwt, payable in 4 months

according to what the buyer tells me, which is 5s below the market price. I cannot conceive

what his purpose is in doing so but, meanwhile, that is the reason why I have had to sell at

£6 6s. How would it have been if the consignment had been bigger? I fear it would have
gone badly. Therefore I would be very glad if you gentlemen [in Sweden] could agree to
send all your copper-wire to me here, so that with all of it in one hand the price could be
maintained and our friends could make a profit. I am inclined to believe that that will come to
pass (which I heartily wish for) for my Lord Cronström informed me in his letter of
19 February that, upon the return to Stockholm of Abraham Wolters from Hamburg, I shall
be sent some terms of correspondence and that he has recommended me. Whatever may
come of it I shall be glad to learn for I would be happy to see your trade flourish, of which
there is a sufficient prospect as it would be of great advantage to those gentlemen. For me,
that is the most important consideration, and I look out for any way of serving you better;
and, in order to encourage our friends in this matter I shall be content (with regard to the
trade in copper-wire and copper-wares) with 1 1/2 per cent commission and 5 per cent per
annum for interest on money advanced upon current account. As regards discount, that
would continue at 6 per cent as most of the debts only get paid in cash 1, 2 or 3 months after
the due date. You could put this proposal (if it suits you) to our other friends and I have no
doubt that it will greatly facilitate the business.

As regards the sale of goods, you will have no reason for anything but satisfaction, and the
interests of our friends will always remain uppermost with me. Please now write to our
friends to submit this proposal and let me know what success you have. I would not trouble
you with this if it were not that the matter concerns you principally, so I hope you will forgive me. Yours, &c.","Amsterdam: 35s 2g (2 usances).

welcome letters of the 25th and 29th of April and 6th of May. With the first I see that I run a
great risk of losing my good old correspondents; with the second you give me reason to hope
that you will stand by me, and with the last you confirm that you will continue with me and
thereupon order me to get insured for £5.000 the goods which you propose to consign to me
in the ship called t’Graffelycke Huys de la Gardie, which I shall negotiate to have done at the
best possible terms and will inform you when I succeed. Meanwhile, I am waiting for the bill
of lading and beg God to bring the ship and its cargo in safety, and whenever it arrives I shall
do the utmost within my powers to sell the goods for your greatest profit. One pays 2 per
cent here for insurance from Stockholm, and I hope to be able to select good insurers at that
price, for which I shall do my best.

By way of answer to your welcome letters I must say, truthfully, that your complaints
have upset me not a little, for I have not been accustomed to hear such things from my
friends, though my comfort has been that you would find me innocent of the intention
which you charge me with. For the £200 formerly drawn by you on me, payable to the
order of Antony Bruyn, has been fulfilled by me without the least delay or disrespect to your
bill, and I shall reimburse myself from the effects which you will be sending me this spring. It
is true that in passing I wrote a word about it to the Messrs Van Baerle asking, if they did not
mind, if might set it against the account of goods which I had in hand; but I never sought nor
in the least intended to reimburse myself out of the goods which I had in hand, or to divert
anything against their intentions or goodwill. They misunderstood what I wrote, and as soon
as I had their answer about the bill (the £200 being by then already paid) I wrote back to
them without a moment’s loss that they had badly interpreted my letter and that—as I have
said above—I only wanted to be reimbursed from the promised effects; and since they
informed me that they had written to you about the matter as they understood it, so I begged
you to forgive the blunder and to think no more about it, as I now do, hoping that no such
error will recur again.

Now, I rejoice from the bottom of my heart that my proposal came in time to confirm our
correspondence, and the conditions which I therewith offered I confirm with this, trusting
that you and the other friends will be content with them and do nothing to reduce the
commission. I can well believe that some people from other places may offer to serve you for
1 per cent commission (although that is very little for a person who wants to do his duty
properly) but London differs considerably from other places, and I would say that a person
can profit more in Hamburg by working for 1 per cent than here for 2 per cent, and one can
do more there with one servant than here with two; for over there they have banks where
most money is paid; the town is small, and thus all your debtors are under your eye; there are
few difficulties in the Customs house; great quantities are bought, mainly for re-export
elsewhere, and for cash. But here it is different. We have to receive and pay outall our money
ourselves, and the town is large and many customers live 2 or 3 miles from the Exchange, to
whom one has to run, which causes expense and for which several people have to be
employed. The trouble we have with our customs officials is impossible to describe, for there
is no question, quibble or quirk but they know how to torment the merchant with it; and
then, in order to sell the goods, one has to deal with people who will only buy small quantities
and then take pleasure in making me and my servants run after them for payment over 2 or 3
months; so, considering all that, I hope you will think and believe that my commission is very
reasonable and be satisfied that, as regards the iron, the commission may also be reckoned at
1 1/2 per cent.

If you give orders to draw some sum on me at the same time that you send the bill of
lading and instructions for insurance, as you are proposing, I shall follow your orders on the
understanding that your intention will be to draw only a part of the value of the goods, for an
insurance policy cannot be thought of as complete cover—firstly, because it is customary
here in case ofa loss (from which, may God preserve us!) for the insurers to deduct usually 10,
12 or 15 per cent of the principal, and thus the premium here is always smaller than at
Amsterdam or Hamburg, &c; but if the goods have arrived here I shall be always ready to
advance three-quarters or more of the value, either by remitting the money or having it
drawn on me, as it suits you.

One reason which has impelled me to want to serve our friends for 1 1/2 per cent commission
and 5 per cent per annum interest has been to be excused from advancing anything before I
first have goods in hand, so that some of my clients—who entrust me with considerable
sums—may be so much the easier in their minds. However, in order to demonstrate to you
my affection and respect, I shall be happy to extend a thousand or twelve hundred pounds
advance during the winter to be reimbursed by you in the spring, just as you have proposed,
never in the least doubting your punctuality. I beg you to say or write nothing about this to
anyone because I am not contemplating advancing anything to other friends in such a
manner, and whenever they learn that one is allowing one friend such terms they think they
have a right to demand similar ones.

I heartily wish you had informed me about your displeasure over what I wrote to Messrs
Van Baerle concerning the aforementioned £200, and I thank you warmly for telling me
about it now, begging you in our future friendship to write to me if it should ever happen
that you have some occasion for displeasure; and I promise you that I shall respond in such a
Way as to remove all misunderstanding, for some time things can be said or done with the
best of intentions (or, at least, without evil intentions) which being otherwise interpreted can turn out badly. Wherewith, cordial regards, &c.","Amsterdam: 35s 1g (2 usances).
