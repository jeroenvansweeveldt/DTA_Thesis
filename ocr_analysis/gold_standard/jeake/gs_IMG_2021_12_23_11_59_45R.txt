curre in order thereto remember me to Mr Boys & tell him his son presents
him his duty & is well with his family. His horse will be sold you may tell him
& if he can by any conveniency send me a horse next weeke to Maidstone to
be there on Thursday then I would come thence God willing on Friday if he
cannot [word struck out] send me one to be there accordingly then do you
write me to be here by next post on Monday & speake to Slowman on Monday
to send me up a Horse to be here next Thursday. Tell Mr Miller I thinke I
shall bring home his Rings againe I am offered so little for them remember me
to him & other friends in general as if named. I have no newes to write you
