Ah my dear (but unkind) Heart
Hath not all my love merited a line from thee to be satisfied of thy welfare? I
have not forgotten since I was promised letters full of kisses, and that often.
Prithee my Deare if my love deserue any thing, let me know where thou art,
how thou dost, and when I may comfort my languishing and sorrowful heart
with hopes to see thee thou never wentest away from me so, but wouldest tell
me some time of returne. For my part I take God to witness I am very restles,
discontented and cannot tell by what means to injoy any thing of my selfe
without thee. I know not and that grieves mee whether this will come to thy
hand, if it doenot what shall I doe, oh that I might injoy thee one night instead
of every nights dreames on thee. I confes I live a most wretched comfortless
solitary and indeed heartles life. Oh that my heart should have such a fresh
spring of love, so lasting, and so coming after its deare Jewell & not decay!
Truly it makes me astonished and amazed at my selfe. I could (but that
experience too sadly convincedth me) have believed it impossible love could
after so many sharp incourters, so many grand repulses, remaine uncon-
quered imperfection of it first springing. But God knows I know not any
thing thou canst doe to me, or against me, can subdue it. It hath been used
too barbarously and heathenishly, yet it is not offended, & that addeth to my
misery. My love me thinks tis too unnaturall to render contempt for love,
slighting for a deare affection. Thou know it how boundless my love hath
been, how unfeigned I need not here rehearse, and how durable the weariness
of my many & great repulses too much to testify. Is there noe reward for
vertue? Is there no jewell transparent but gold? Ah my Dear Heart consider
how many have been ruined by breaking their engaged faith & promise there
is a time for every thing and certainly if thou wast afraid of God's Judgements
in poor Mr Harding's case I know not how it can be otherwise, may I believe
tis much worse in mine: for I suppose he might in proces of time have married
another, I must not. Thou wouldst be accounted iust in thy dealing, I pray
God give thee a heart to be so to me but yet I believe never poor lover had
more iniury and harder dealing than I have. Good my Dear Heart think upon
me, and consider what I suffer for thy sake, poise the burden that lies on my
heart but in thy thoughts, make but my case thine a little & weigh it in equity
and doe not let all my life be spent in sorrows, and all comforts taken from me
att all my Daies. I would I could but send thee one of my present bitter
groanes or that thou mightest but for the twinkling of an eye feel my aking
heart, surely thy closed nature could not but relent and a little dissolve from
its frozen hardnes. The God of Heaven mollify thy hard hart and make it
more naturall and not so stony to me. I know thou expectest mercy at Gods
