The End of the War, 1696-1697 243

for such is the humor here up & down everyday almost. So that this is the
venture: next Monday comes [news] from Holland mail & it depends on that
rise or fall but I must venture [some]thing or else do nothing, so that I mean
to buy one 100 more & [word lost] the demur of the peace, for I hope that may
not be a long demur, & if [news] of the conclusion of the peace should come
then I believe it will be at 100 in a days time, so that then it will be to late, for
I am resolved not to follow it so high. E: India stock is sunk to 54. & I find no
encoura[gement] to do any thing there at present. I resolve to be very cautious
of that. I shall have money enough here with my bank note of Â£27 16s 9d to
pu[rchase] this 100 in the Bank, so I shall not need to take up any of Mr
Fer[ris] except what I shall pay him again here whilst I stay in London. [If]
John Dickson ask you about the bond I have to receive for him the man says
he will pay it about a week hence perhaps it may be fortnight since but I am
apt to think it be paid in some little time. Flaxseed I have not thought yet
about: so proceed according to the Instructions I left with you. I [word lost]
Mr Tucker may have wrote his son the prizes of Hops. I have [no] leisure yet
to go into Southwark nor seen him since we parted [word lost] Mr Miller's
folks are all in the country. My duty to my mother, love [to] children & all
friends. Which with my affection to you is all at present.
Your ever lo: husband
Sa: Jeake.

Tell Betty I intend to write to her before long. I hope you will not complain
now of a short lett[er].

London Sept 7th 1697
My Dear
The enclosed I desire you to deliver. I send them this way because I would not
send that to Mr Maior by post. I suppose old Mr Tucker will give directions
to his son sufficiently cautious about hops. I am not forward to give 10 in the
Country, because the risque is great in coming up. For if one bag come to
damage it sweeps away the profit of a load. As to flaxseed, proceed according
to the directions I left you; Only if you find any one that is positive that he will
not take under 4s 6d per bushel for brown flaxseed & if it be very good. Then
