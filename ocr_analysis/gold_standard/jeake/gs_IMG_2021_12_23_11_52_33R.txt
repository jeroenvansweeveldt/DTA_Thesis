Deare Heart
I kindly thanke thee for thy loveing letter my tyme is soe short; that I cannot
write what I would, but I trust to speake with thee shortly: yet it will be mid-
dle of next weeke before I can come for I had thoughts to have beene with
thee on munday next but I have employments with the mayor. Prethee excuse
my brevity & present my kind respects to Mrs Blackwood & thus with my
prayers for you I remaine

your ever lo: consort
Samuell Jeake

Deare Sister
I have sent your joynture ready for sealing if you proceed on in finishing your
marriage before I come backe which I would counsell now to doe (especially
if it be his desire) then let Mr Jeake seale the joynture first to my unkle John
Hartridge for you and then let him seale the bond but if you see the bond be
offensive to him you wave it for it is of no great moment where wee deale with
honest persons of which I judge him to be one. Though I bee put in as a
feoffee for you with my unkle yet if I could not come so soone as I desire &
your occation will require yet will it be sufficient without me if made over to
my unkle my praiers shall not bee wanting for your good success in your
business. I have sent Goodye Darbye her virginall strings they cost a shilling.
If you should marrye before I come backe yet would I not have you to goe to
Rye till my returne if the Lord shall please to bring me backe but if he should
not bring me backe the journey being long and my bodily strength weake yet
I hope wee shall meete and bee for ever with the lord. Remember my warning
take heed of hardness of heart in time of prosperitie [words struck out]
endeavour to please him that shall be your husband and dwell with him with
an amiable meekenes & contendedness of minde and doe not greeve his spirit
