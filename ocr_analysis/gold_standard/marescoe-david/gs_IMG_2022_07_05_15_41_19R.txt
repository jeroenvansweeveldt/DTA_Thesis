'These are by returne of our Generall Ships, and in answer of yours of the 25th June.
Concerning the ballance of your account Sir John Lethieullier advised me to have paid you
some time since. As for the intrest of 6 per cent which you are pleased to leave to me, I made
you good parte of it in the cambio of your pieces of eight, which findeing I could not send
you returnes I sold at time by which you got upwards of 3 per cent more than any other of
my frinds. After I received your money in possestion if could have got you any more intrest
had been faithfully allowed, but being sorry you lost the benifitt of the investment of your
money I charged you with no provision for receiveing, all which I hope will satisfye, and if
take your freedome of the Turky Company that you will be pleased to honour me with your
imployment, which I promise shall be done to as much advantage as any of my other frinds. I
shall not trouble you with a sortement of cloth, nor doe I desyre you, if you incline to trade
this way, to send any but peeces of eight, lyon dollers and cocheniele, by which you will have
quick returnes and in those goods you desyre. We have had this yeare a great deale of trouble
and charge, the old Vizier being dead,1 he that is present in his place is so pore or covitious that
from all Christian imbassidors hath exacted great somes of money and from those that are not
willing to parte with it he makes one pretence or other and so takes it per force, as he hath don
to our imbasador, pretending our new Lion Dollars which were brought by the last Generall
Ships were falce, but parte of them being tryed were found to be good, not withstanding he
would have his demands, being LD 15,000 or elce would have melted the whole sume which
was LD 200,000, there being no remedy but patience, but our imbassadore wrights that no
further trouble will be given for the future, which hope will take care to prevent or elce our
trade in these partes are lost. Sir, by the Prosperous, Capt. Henry Clarke, I have sent a sayet of
No. 1 pistaches, which beg your acceptance, being marked and nombred as per margin, which is all
I know worth your notice at present. I remaine, Sir, your most humble servant at comand.'

Your very welcome letters of the 15th of February and 12th of April came to me safely, from
which I have seen what prices Swedish goods are fetching in [England]. I am most grateful to
you, but because of the pending war between France and England and other sad
circumstances that one sees developing more and more, every day, one dares not risk sending
anything from here. One is living here almost as if one were bound hand and foot, and the
iron, garcopper and copper-wire which comes to market here is mostly sold to strangers.
There can only be one person in a hundred who is currently exporting on his own account,
and when anything does get done it is in the name of someone overseas, which still carries its
dangers. Apart from that, we are living in great ignorance about what is happening abroad
since our correspondence has been taken away and it can easily be three months before one
can get any answer from Holland and [England]. This creates uncertainty, so that it is nearly
impossible to get anything insured, and when correspondence is removed in such a way the
