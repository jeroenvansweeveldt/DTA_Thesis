248 The Marescoe-David Letters, 1668-1680

cannot guarantee so large an amount until we see how the mine turns out, which one can do
better when it is working. We will send the iron and copper to Gothenburg. When the works
are in operation I shall probably have need of 3,000 to 5,000 RD at a low rate of interest. If
you were willing to accommodate me I could ensure that you receive large commissions.
Please send me your views on this as soon as possible, as well as the price of anchors and bar-
iron. If I see any profit in them I shall send you some in the Spring. I look forward to your
answer on all this, with cordial greetings, &c.

'Je croy que vous pouvez fort bien donner ordre aux Maistres de Suede qu'ils monter la
riviere et qu'ils dechargent leur marchandises, car il nous est permis en nostre Traitte
d'achepter des vaisseaux et de nous en servir moyenant que les Maistres soyent Suedois. Et je
tacheray bien a les defendre. C'est tout que peut dire.

[P.S.] Je seray a la Bourse ci devant Midi en esperance de diner avec vouse.
En cas des troubles je ne mancqueray pas de soustenir nostre priviledge.'

[LONDON] 14 OCTOBER 1668

'Honored friend, I was this morning at Court with my Memorial and when I was
recommending it to My Lord Privy Seal,1 he immediately told me that it was to no purpose
to deliver it over to the Lords Commissioners to expect their resolution on it, for they could
not [move?] absolutely in it, after that the King and Councell had given once his resolution to
the contrary. And whereas I grounded my Memoriall upon the 10th Article of the Treaty of
London and the 19th of the Treaty of Stockholm,2 he immediately told me that he would tell
me as a friend, that he knew those articles grounded upon some provisoes and therefore
advised me as his friend to apply me directly to the King, assuring me that for all he was my
friend he would be against me if I had it once more for the Councill. I send you the treaty that
you may see the proviso of the [18th] Article3 as also an extract of the other, but I have left
out all words which ware between here and there to our prejudice, as that word tempore belli
and the like.4 So that I think it the best to stay a day or 2 rather then to spoile the whole
business by too great an importunity. I will be with you tomorrow upon the Exchange and
speake further with you.

Adieu.

[P.S.] I intreat you to send me the remnant of your promise. My man hath a generall
quittance under my owne hand.'

81.
3 Leyonbergh mistakenly writes '13th'.
4 In a postscript to his letter of 15 October, Leyonbergh adds the text of the inconvenient proviso in article 18
of the Stockholm treaty of 1665, vizt. 'Quod tempore belli naves utriusque Foederatorum eorumque subditorum
mercatoriae, sive fuerint in Regnis Magnae Britanniae Sueciaeve illisque subjectis Provinciis et Ditionibis vel alibi extructae,
sive consensu vel permissione Regia aliunde emptae....[to]....nihil praeterea ab illa exigatur...'. For the text see Parry,
VIII, p. 272.
