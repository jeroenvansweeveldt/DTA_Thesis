October) which were only forwarded and now wee have received yours of the 20 October,
approveing of our accompt currant except that wee had creditted you $734.19.6 in lieu of
$727.12.3 for proceed of the wyer, which wee find to bee as you say, so that wee shall debt
you for the errour in a new accompt in $7.7.3. Inclosed you have an exact price courant will
enforme you how all commodities governe here,1 which certainely never were so low, nor
our trade worse, lead sould dayly att D.18 1/2 p. mille and yet wee cannot compute any gaine
made theron though very cheape in England. Tinne D.11 1/2, pepper at D.10, about which
prices its judged these commodities may govern and if pepper doe not fall lower wee judge
money is got therby. Such another parcell of wyer as you sent us may also find vent att same
price, all woollen manufactory in very low esteeme, the French outdoing us in cheapnesse
and if gaine farther footing in Sicilly (and wee wish they are not too soone masters of the
whole island) wee shall vent no more of our manufactory in that country. The Richard &
William and Freind for Naples and Madera Merchant for Palermo are this weeke departed and
none being imported wee have not to enlarge but with due respect remaine, Sir, att your
command.'
