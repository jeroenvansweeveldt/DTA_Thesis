406 The Marescoe-David Letters, 1668-1680

since little iron has been forged here this winter and large amounts have been bought up for
pretty high prices.

With regard to the proceeds of your salt, I have written to you at length that it would be to
your best advantage if I settled it against your current account, because the iron was dearly
bought and it was not advisable to store the salt since it could not be sold for so high a price in
the spring. I am now being offered a ship-load of salt by English merchants for 15 dollars per
ton and I see that you are thinking of consigning me another quantity of salt in the new year.
If you do so I shall dispose of it to your best advantage.

Regarding the bill of exchange on Johan Fahlgreen: it is not yet paid. I have sent your letter
to him, and I do not doubt that payment will soon follow as I have had news from Westras,2
where the money is to delivered, that it is daily expected there, so I hope your letter of
attorney will be unnecessary. Johan Trotzig has not yet paid up and I can get no answer from
him, though I have been told by his brother-in-law in Stockholm that he would pay shortly.
In future you would do well not to extend such credit, as you can be sure of a heap of trouble
and a long wait. I have sent the RD 100 bill of exchange on Johan Staelhaus to Stockholm for
acceptance and will give you news of it by my next. I see that Captain Guttery has arrived at
Gothenburg and I have written there to know how things stand with the goods. It is dreadful
that the posts are so unreliable and that we are mutually lacking so many letters. I cannot tell
what remittances you have made for me to Mr Van de Mortel and, since the 20th of August, I
have received no letters from him. However, I hope you have withheld the proceeds of the
iron in the last two ships in order to offset the proceeds of your salt and the sum of the bills of
exchange which, I think, altogether should just about balance each other.

I have advised you before this that Mr Perman has given orders to Mr David Leyel [in
London] to pay you the £150 relating to Jacob Fahlgreen;3 and with regard to your claims
on Willem Momma I have not until now (with the power of attorney) received the necessary
information, but as the goods have been sold to Mr Perman (as I wrote to you before) there is
nothing which can be done now. Also, Momma says that he is no longer in debt to you, as
you perfectly well know. You would do well to obtain your claims on him amicably, like a
sensible chap.4

Because the money in your account has now been offset there is nothing to be said about
the purchase of brass, but if you send a consignment of salt in the spring please write fully to
order what you want done with the proceeds. I commend you to the protection of God,
together with Madame, your dearly beloved;

&c.

[P.S.] Regarding the exportation of iron, I shall inform you further.

1 The Royal African Company.
2 I.e. Västerås, 111 km west of Stockholm.
3 Jacob David's Swedish-born clerk-apprentice, taken on for £150, and later sent to Sweden to sort out his,
and David's, affairs. [See 368.]
