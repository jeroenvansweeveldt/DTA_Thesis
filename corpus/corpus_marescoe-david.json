He is away at present and has been expected back for some\ndays. We have noted what has been happening in the sale of our goods and will await the\naccount thereof, It is good to see that Dirck Thyssen has delivered to you the 324 bars of iron\nand the 20 barrels of steel on our account, and we also note the price at which you have sold\nthe steel, but we are not happy to learn that some of the barrels were of such short weight. We\nwill make enquiries here, as they were weighed at the works by our own people who have\nexpress orders always to ensure that, including the barrels, they weigh net 120 lb. Danzig-\nweight. We weigh it in this manner, as in Danzig, so that the barrels together with any excess\nweight have been paid for. See if they weighed it in this way in [London], or have weighed\nthe steel only without the barrels, and please let me known for my future guidance. And as I\nhave the opportunity to send a good deal of such steel (having that privilege from His\nMajesty) I beg you to let me know how large an amount you would be able to consume\nyearly so that I can employ my works accordingly.\n\nInote that pitch and tar have fallen in price in [London]: I shall be glad to be kept informed\nof further developments. I have also noted the money you have remitted to Mr Caspar\nBruyn, as well as the \u00a320 you have paid to Mr Johan Simons. I shall be grateful if you would\nhelp in every way, and if he should need another \u00a320 or \u00a330 please let him have it. Any\nmoney which you may have due to us, please make over to Caspar Bruyn as he will need\nsome money on our account. I have already written to Mr Pelt Emanuels that he should place\nthe money which Capt. Fix paid to you to our account. I trust he had done so and will not be\nwriting to you about it any more as we have put his account right.\n\nWe long to hear that Capt. Coomen, who is sailing to [London] from Gotland, has arrived\nsafely and that his timber has found a good market. Our agent in Gotland tells us that it is\nvery fine timber, and doubtless with the rebuilding of London a great deal of wood will be\nrequired. Please find out for us if some ships\u2019 lading of such balks and deals would sell on\ndelivery and if one could get a good price for them, as we would gladly oblige. No one is in a\nbetter position to do so as we can have all the timber which Gotland produces in our hands.\nSo please make inquiries and let us know what you think. We can have it cut to such lengths\nand breadths as people want, and the deals also, but you must write to us with the\nmeasurements\u2014and please find out if we are free to send them in Dutch ships.\n\nThe 6 tuns of potash, which will be sent to you with the first available ship, are only an\nexperiment, and if we perceive any profit in it we will send a larger amount. It is the same\nwith the Gotland tar, which always costs more than Swedish tar. Do your best in all this as if\nit were for yourself, and let us have your detailed comments so that we can act accordingly.\nWe have noted what you wrote about the kinds of iron which sell, and it is most instructive.\nWith God\u2019s help we will provide you with a large amount in the spring.\n\nAs my brother Jacob will not be living here regularly but will be spending most of his time\nat his brass-foundry in Norrk\u00f6ping, we have divided our trading, and what hitherto came\nfrom here please regard as mine only, unless it is expressly stated to belong to someone else\u2019s\naccount. You will likewise get directions from me about what has, and will, come from\nGotland, so from now on I will be writing to you in my own name and you can reply to me\nlikewise so we can settle matters with one another. However, what you have just remitted to\nAmsterdam and have in your hands from here and Gotland is still in both our names.\nFarewell, &c.",

    "TEXT": "Our last letter was about a week ago, with which we remitted to you a bill of exchange for\n\u00a3166 9s 2d sterling for your account. Herewith goes the second copy in case the first is lost.\nSince then we have received your letter of the 20th past with the following remittances for\nthe account of Mr Willem Momma at Nyk\u00f6ping, vizt.\n\n\u00a3240 at 345 4g, 2 usances, in your own bill on Nicholas Korf;\n\n\u00a380 as above, on Anselmus Hartsen;\n\n\u00a3100 as above, in a bill of Jean Dorville on Frederick Dorville;\n\n\u00a374 13s 4d at 34s 7g, 2 1/3 usances, in a bill of Daniel Porten on Joseph van Ast at Antwerp.\n\nWe have secured acceptance of the first and also the last, and have informed Momma. The\nremittances were for the proceeds of the copper-wire out of Pieter Hartman and William\nGreene, of which we have made a note. We look forward to learning what else has occured in\nthe sale of the remaining copper-wire and brass, though while the exchange is so very low\nplease do not remit the proceeds. We must hope that the exchange improves; meanwhile, sell\nfor the shortest time possible.\n\nAs regards Nicholas Korf, he is a man of little credit and small business, who is not much to\nbe relied on; we understand he is going to live in Rotterdam next month, for your\ninformation.\n\nWe have received the bill of lading for the sugar shipped in John Goldsborough, but the\ninvoice and the list of weights is not with it, so please let us have it. Concerning the freight,\nwe will see if they will be satisfied with 4.000 lb. net per last; ifnot, we must pay for the gross\nweight as is customary here.\n\nWe see that you have recorded your agreement with the account of the sugar from\nMackrel, but that the tare, short-weight and allowance for prompt payment takes away most\nof the profit. The tare of 15 per cent on big barrels and 16 on small is a customary condition\nhere which it is useless to dispute; the 1 per cent for making good short weight has also been\nclaimed by the sugar-refiners for some time and without it they will not offer a penny; and\nthe 1 per cent for prompt payment is advantageous to the vendor if he otherwise has to wait\nthree months for payment.\n\nThe price of Barbados sugar remains still between 7 3/8g to 7 7/8g according to quality. We\nhave had no news of James Hatton or of John Goldsborough, although as the wind is\nfavourable we expect to have news of their arrival any day.\n\nOf the lead, we have only sold 50 pigs of the great lead from Anthony Winter to Jacob\nCharles at 28s 6g flem. with 1 per cent discount for payment within 3 weeks. There is no\ndemand for small lead at the moment. We have written to our friend in Rotterdam to sell the\n100 pigs of lead from Bywater as best he can but have had no answer. English tin is selling at\n\nf.50 1/2 but it is believed it will shortly fall to f-50 since, according to the latest letters which\ncame from France three days ago, it seems there is again some hope of agreement being made\nwith Spain. What foundation there is for this we shall see.\n\nWe herewith forward Mr Hanson\u2019s answer to your letter.=With heartiest regards, &c.",

    "TEXT": "Dear Sir, We last wrote about a week ago; since then we have received yours of the 15th past\nto which the following is our answer.\n\nWe have sold the 26 hogsheads of Barbados sugar, which came with [Capt.] Adrian\nGoossen, to Paulus Kalckberner at 73 with 1 per cent discount for immediate payment, and\nthe 42 blocks of tin from [Capt.] Philip Cockran to Matthys Booden at f-503 per 100 lb. on\nthe same terms. Herewith we send the account of both, together with an account of the 693\npieces of small lead from (Capt.] George Fowler. The net proceeds of the sugar amount to\n\u2018f.2676 17st; of the tin, to f-4674; and of the lead, to f.5753 1st 8g, all in bank money. Please\ncheck them, and, if you find no mistakes, make a record of them.\n\nThe amount of sugar which has come to Zeeland from Surinam is not nearly as great as we\nhad first been told, and seems to be about 400.000 lb., as a result of which Barbados sugar is\nbeing maintained at 7g to 74g, but as the demand for refined sugar is small there is little\nprospect oft rising and we cannot guess what future prices can be obtained, so we wish you\nwould consider it preferable to sell it in London.\n\nGreat lead was selling in Rotterdam for 27s 6g flem. and it cannot be sold here for more\nthan 28s at three months time. Since you have complained about the low price we have kept\nunsold what there is here and at Rotterdam. As for the small lead out of Henry Kirckhouse\nwe have sold 100 pieces to Marten Van Lidt at 275 3g with 1 per cent discount for immediate\npayment. Since then, we have been offered only 27s at three months. We shall be glad to learn\nif the tin account answered your expectations. Various amounts have been sold at f'505, and if\nthe expected East India ships bring no tin the price could well improve. You will have heard\nby now what the three East India ships which arrived here brought with them: we forgot to\ntell you in our last letter.\n\nWe still cannot send you the sale-account of the 18 barrels of sugar in [Capt.] Mackrel since\nwe have not settled with the captain yet. We find that some of the barrels in Mackrel, as well\nas in Goossen, do not weigh as much as they should according to the invoice. We suspect they\nhave been tampered with by the sailors though we do not know any means of getting\nrestitution as the barrels seem, to all appearances, intact. The captains will not admit to any\nknowledge of the reduced weight.\nWe intended to remit you herewith all your proceeds, but have been unable to find\nsatisfactory bills as so much money has been remitted to London today that the exchange has\nrisen, as you can see below, so we remit you only:\n\n\u00a3700 sterling in a bill of Bartolotti & Rihel, to be received at 2 usances from Laurence\nDibusty @ 34s 11 1/2d;\n\n\u00a3168 125 4g, which is W.745 23s @ 54 1/2d, dated 6 April, drawn on Rudolf Lee, endorsed\nby us and reckoned at 34s 11g. Please procure their acceptance and credit us. As for the \u00a3100\nsterling @ 35s 6g which you have remitted us on Dirck van Huisbergen due on the 4th\ninstant, we shall procure payment and make youa return. We understand that Nicholas Korf\nhas left for London. Your two drafts on him have been registered in the bank for us by his\nbrother-in-law Barthout Ockers. This first is due in six days and the other before the\ndeparture of the post.\n\nWe regret to see the poor price of copper-wire and do not know how to advise you except\nto follow the orders of our friends in Sweden. The copper-wire from Norrk\u00f6ping is nearly as\ngood as Hamburg wire and is now selling at f-55 per 100 lb. The \u2018Crowned N\u2019 variety is\nselling at f.54 so it is no use bringing it from here or from Hamburg at the price it is fetching\nwith you. Although the amount which our Swedish friends have sent is too large, the kettles,\npans, latten and other brassware ought to fetch a good price, seeing that the French have\nwrecked the brass-works round Aachen and chased away the workers.\n\nJacob Momma advises us that a ship called St Jan Battista, Captain Claes Symons Schult, is\nbeing loaded for London in which he intends to send a good quantity of brass and iron. We\nwere also glad to see that the amount coming here has not made the price weaken. In due\ncourse you will please make good the proceeds as Momma doubtless will instruct you.\nHerewith is one of his letters for you, with which our hearty regards, &c.\n\n&c.",

It is not\nthe case that I wrote that the cannon-balls should come to London, nor was it ever my\nintention, and if it seems to say so in my letter of the 8th instant then it was badly copied, for\nthe intention is that ifa good opportunity should arise at the place where the cannon-balls are\nlying to send them to Lisbon then it should not be neglected but taken at once.\n\nI am glad to see that you have sold a quantity of iron. I shall not be able to send so much\nvoyage iron this year, for it was only made at one forge and I ordered all of it to be sent to\nyou, and as the forge was making other sorts of iron last winter there will probably not be so\nmuch. They write from Stockholm that iron is coming in rather slowly, so it may be rather\nlate before the ships depart, and if there is a demand for what you already have, try to regulate\nconsumption by concealing 1/8 or 1/9 of the quantity.\nI have been approached here about selling my share of the iron which was in the Stockholm,\nwrecked on the English coast.(1) They think to get it for 4 or 5 per cent, but I have disposed of\nit for one-third. If 1 decide otherwise I shall send someone from here to fish it up. Time will\ntell what further developments may follow.\n\nNews has reached here from St Kitts that more than 2.000,000 lb. of sugar has been\ndestroyed by fire on Barbados and that few houses have been damaged. I hope it is not really\nso bad: may the Lord grant consolation for such a heavy affliction.\n\nHerewith I remit you \u00a3221 5s@ 34s 10\u00a2 for your account. I have not yet had the account\nfrom Reval, but that can do no harm since the man must have money. I wish it was the same\nwith that from Copenhagen, where I am lacking both the account and my money.

    "TEXT": "I find myself owing an answer to your letters of the 27th of March, 3rd, 10th of April and\n8th of May, which herewith follows.\nI have looked over the accounts you have sent and have adjusted them as you will have\nseen in the enclosed note. If you find them correct please make a record of it. The 65 RD from\nBaron Sparr (1) have not yet been received but they will be shortly and will then be placed to\nyour credit. The \u00a330 you have paid to Mr Jan Simons has also been noted, and if he should\nwant another \u00a330 or \u00a340 please let him have it and place it on my account.\n\nThe schuit (2) which I am thinking of using for salvage work is now ready to sail. It is called\nthe St Peter and the captain is Matthys Meyer. I have consigned her lading to you for my\naccount as you will see from the enclosed bill of lading. May God protect her and bring her in\nsafety! I rely on you to do your best to sell the goods. Among them are two bundles of band-\niron, hammered not drawn, and I shall be glad to learn how well they sell. In Holland band-\niron has sold at 2 1/2 to 3 per cent higher than fine bar-iron, and if it fetches a good price in\n[London] I am in a good position to have it made. I await your comments.\n\nI have read the detailed report which you have written to me about timber, which is\ninstructive, but to charter as many ships as you suggest is hardly advisable as freight-rates are\ntoo high. However, I shall see what I can do. We are expecting two salt-ships at Gotland\n(may God bring them safely) and they will then be sent to [London] with timber.\nMeanwhile, keep me informed about what is happening to this commodity in [London].\n\nIsce that you have sold the 16 lasts of Gotland tar at \u00a310 10s per last, which is a poor price.\nIt may well be that it is not as highly esteemed in [London] as Stockholm tar, but in other\nplaces they give a good deal more for it than for what comes from here. To charter ships from\n[London] to here is not opportune as by now as many as 14 Setubal salt-ships are passing\nthrough the Sound from here and they all have consignments in them.\n\nJan Juyst has paid me the \u00a367 tos for Jan Simons\u2019 bill of exchange, and I have credited\nyour account.\n\nIsce you have been unable to get any buyers yet for the 6 tuns of potash. They were only\nsent as an experiment: please do your best with them and see how much they can fetch, for\nour future guidance. If it proves worthwhile we may send a further quantity.\n\nI note you to say that at least 6.000 houses are being built in [London], which must\nconsume a great deal of timber. You also say that you think at least 1.000 to 1.500 lengths of\nGotland beams at 40s per length and 20.000 to 25.000 deals at \u00a36 10s per hundred could be\nsold\u2014to which you await our decision. In answer I can only say that I cannot supply such a\nquantity while freight-rates are so high. However, we will see what we can do. My brother\nJacob is in Gotland at present and has a ship-builder with him as we are thinking of having\nsome fluyt-ships built there\u2014so with wood and timber-ware may God grant us fortune and\nHis blessing!\n\nMeanwhile, keep me always informed about what is happening in [London] concerning\ntimber-ware. I am glad to see that small-iron is now sought after in [London], because what I\nsend is mostly of that sort. Keep me informed how each type is selling. That you have been\nable to get 15s [per cwt.] for our \u2018voyage\u2019 iron is good news. If I were certain that it could\nalways sell like that I would have a large amount forged, so I shall await your opinion on this.\nPlease also let me know how Setubal salt is selling in [London].\n\nIsee that you have consulted with Jan Simons about the surety for the goods which are still\nin the wreck of the Stockholm and I note your opinion on the matter, which is helpful. I have\nwritten to Jan Simons at greater length in the enclosed letter. Please hand it to him and help\nhim in every way, for which we will be most grateful.\n\nI have not been able to get the schuit ready for use sooner, otherwise it would have left for\n[England] by now. God protect him and bring him in safety\u2014and then I hope something\nmay be achieved this summer, as time will tell.\nI have loaded for my account in the Deensche Pheenix, which will be ready in a few days:\n\nSlb. 884.12 various sorts of fine bar-iron;\nSlb. 263.6 rod-iron;\n\n106 casks of steel in tall casks;\n\n52 ditto in flat casks;\n\n83 1/2 dozen long deals, to complete the cargo,\n\nall of which is consigned to you. The bill of lading will be sent with my next letter, and when\nthe ship arrives in [London] I beg you to unload it as soon as possible and speed it on its way to\nSt Ubes in ballast as it has also been chartered by Mr P\u00e9tter as usual so that it can complete its\njourney before the winter. Please help the captain, who is Claus Willman, in every way, and\nwe will be most grateful.\n\nI have ordered these goods, as well as those in the schuit, St Peter to be insured by Peter\nSimons in Amsterdam. I hope to God the premium will be justified. Since I have charged him\nwith some bills of exchange which are going to fall due soon, I have written to tell him to\ncorrespond with you and to draw on you for my account; and if some misfortune should\novertake the goods (which God forbid!) you could draw on him in return as he will have had\nthem insured. And I would like you to allow Mr Simons to draw on you nine or ten thousand\nrixdollars. Please accommodate him. The interest on what you advance will be made good,\nand I shall shortly be sending you more goods of which you will be advised.\n\nYour letters of the 15th and 22nd of May to my brother Jacob have been received in his\nabsence, and \u2014following his instructions\u2014I have opened them and read their contents. I am\ndelighted to see that Capt. Erick Erickson has arrived. God be thanked for his blessings! As to\nthe money you have advanced on his goods\u2014he will gladly make it good, regarding $ per\ncent per month interest as cheap. It is good that you have told Mr Hiebenaer that he may\ndraw on you up to 8.000 RD, and if it does not inconvenience you, you could, according to\nyour offer, remit the remainder to Messrs Van Baerle as it is more profitable for my brother.\nHe will make good the interest on what you advance.\n\nHowever, I am not happy to see that the price of copper-wire is so low, and I hope it will\nimprove. Here copper prices are rising as the copper mine is producing little because of some\nroof-falls which have occurred. I shall inform my brother of what you write about the\nvarious sorts of wire, and I shall be glad to learn to whom the 1.650 coils of wire from Cock\nhave come. As for my brother\u2019s affairs, I hope he will have returned home in a month or six\nweeks time. Your enclosure to Mr Hegerstiern* came to me under the cover of Mr Caspar\nBruyn\u2019s and was accidentally opened in the presence of two good friends. Nothing in it was\nread, but it was sealed up again and sent to his house where he opened it and then sealed it\nagain and returns it to you again. In future, please do not.send him any letters under cover to me or Mr Bruyn. Wherewith, regards, &c.",

A large amount has arrived in\nHolland with the East India ships; in Portugal the Brazil fleet is also expected to bring a great\nquantity, and although in the last two months not much sugar has come from the Barbadoes\nwe still have enough in stock, so it must fall further.

To which we answer that we find it more\nprofitable for Momma and more convenient for us to draw on you at double usance, as we\nwrote previously, and therefore beg you to make no remittances unless something is rebated\nand paid down by the purchasers or unless the exchange rises higher in the near future. You\nwill charge Momma 6 per cent per annum interest on the money you advance on account of\nhis goods (as is provided in our contract with him) making good our share. We trust you do\nnot find it strange that we enjoy some profit thereby, because after all we advance the full\nvalue of the goods without having them in our hands. Nevertheless, if you think 43 per cent\nto be too little interest, you can deduct 5 per cent and leave us to enjoy 1 per cent. Please do\nnot betray this to Momma, so that he is given no grounds for allowing us less than the 6 per\ncent stipulated.\n\nAbout six weeks ago, 20 chests of small copper bars were sent to Isbrant van Holten at\nElsinore, to be consigned to you from there. The proceeds of this are also to be at our disposal\nand we will be glad to learn of its arrival. We have procured acceptance of the \u00a3 100 at 35s 7g\ndouble usance on Peter Dorville.

From\n[Capt.] John Clarke and Marten Bilke we have heard nothing because of contrary winds. We\nare now in the deadest season of the year and believe it would be better to hold back the sugar,\non which we will be glad to have your opinion.

It\nwould be better next time to sell itat \u00a313 10s for time, and my idea was to dispose of only a\nlittle in the hope that square iron would soon be in demand since so little has been sent. You\nshould know best whether there is much square iron around in your area, and if so, you\nshould be able to judge how much to withhold. I rely on you in this to do as you think\nadvisable. I do not quite understand your intention\u2014that is, whether you meant to sell it for\ncash or to barter it for tin and account for it as if the tin had been paid for in cash. If it should\nbe paid for in tin you can send it over here straight away, but please make sure that it is\nsmelted cleanly and not with coal, as it is presently ata rather low price and people are rather\nchoosy!\u2014and if it is pure one immediately has an advantage in selling it.\n\nYou must do this for the square iron but not for the flat iron, unless there is only a little flat\niron remaining, for if one should reckon 8o tons of square and 20 tons of flat at an average of\n\u00a313 per ton then the square iron would work out at scarcely \u00a3124 per ton, since flat iron is\nworth so much more than \u00a313 per ton. According to my best recollection there must be still\nabout 3.000 bars of flat iron, though I may be mistaken as I am in no position here to check it,\nPlease reflect on this and do what you judge suitable. You should also take into consideration\nthat, by all appearances, not more than 2.000 slb of \u2018O\u2019 and \u2018G\u2019 flat iron can be expected, apart\nfrom the voyage iron\u2014that is, if Bex despatched in one ship the rest of the iron he was\nordered to send here.\n\nIf I gave \u00a36 per ton for what is to come from Barbados I would be obliged to load the\nwhole ship, or else he would have to look around for the rest of his lading and I would have to\nmake up for what falls short, or else be responsible for a share of his cargo. It is strange that\nAbcels has not written to advise us how things stand over there, for our guidance.\n\nSince itis rather late for the Pyper to go to Sweden, it is best that he goes to La Rochelle or\nBordeaux for the vendange, for unless some other good opportunity arises I am confident he\nwill get a good return at Bordeaux. Please advise him of this. He reached the Sound on the\n3rd of this month but since then has had contrary winds.\n\nWith which, I remain, &c.",

Their ships are still lying here off-shore but will depart with\nthe first good wind, May the Lord protect them! Herein we send the bills of lading for Jolle\nT'Jerdts and Jacob Jacobsen Grys, also consigned to you, the first of which having 52 lasts\n8 tuns of tar and 17 lasts of pitch, the other having 73 lasts 11 tuns of tar and 20 lasts of pitch.\nMay the Lord guide them also! Captains Elias Johansen and Hans Johansen have also been\nchartered: the first is now loading and the other will begin shortly.\n\nWe had written this far when we got your letter of the 31st of July with which came a\ncopy of the contract which you and Mr Thuen have made together concerning our\nCompany\u2019s business, Through a lack of time we cannot read it over, and we will let you\nknow what we think of it by our next. You say that you want us to send 550 lasts of tar and\n120 lasts of pitch to [London], and the rest of the 700 lasts of tar and 200 of pitch to Hull,\nYarmouth and the Isle of Wight. You will see from the bills of lading how much we have so\nfar sent to [London], being in all 432 lasts 1 tun of tar and 144 lasts of pitch. In addition, as we\nhave just said, Elias Johansen is loading and Hans Johansen has been chartered, so you can\nexpect to get the requested amount of tar at [London] and a good deal more than the\nrequested amount of pitch. But as regards the amounts requested for other places such as\nHull, Yarmouth and the Isle of Wight, we fear we will find no shipping going there, but we\nwill do our best and let you know what we arrange. Concerning insurance and cash advances,\nwe refer you to our previous letter, not doubting that whenever our goods arrive you will,\naccording to contract, advance the money, and we request you to correspond with Mr\nSimons about this as we said in the copy above. Meanwhile we are very glad to hear of the\narrival of Capt. Hans Tennissen: may the Lord God be thanked who with His gracious help\nmay have since brought the others in safety, as they followed him shortly after. We expect to hear soon. If we are going to insure the ships still lying here off-shore we will advise you,\nclosing this with cordial regards, &c.",

If, with the\narrival of future shipments, it should faller lower and you judge the price to be at its lowest,\nthen buy me 12.000 to 15.000 lb., but it is no use to me if it costs more than 26s, and it must be\nchoice stuff, because there is plenty here and I must have only the very choicest, choice\nquality. Always bear that in mind when buying for me. The ships from Scanderoon have\narrived and in your opinion galls are at their lowest. If you can get 20 barrels for less than sos\nmake sure the galls are big, heavy and blue. Aleppo galls are also welcome here. Camphor is\nregarded asa drug; it comes in little tubs, looks like snow but when refined is like crystal and\nat present fetches here 4o stuivers unrefined and so stuivers refined. If what they call camphor\nin [England] can be had for 6 to 10s it must be something else, so if possible send me a sample\nof the raw commodity for my guidance. If it can be brought here for less than 40 stuivers I\nwould buy 500 lb. It is also used for perfume.\n\nSir, I would like to have 2.000 to 3.000 lb. of syrup from [London], but syrup is not\nallowed to be imported here unless it pays 1 stuiver per lb. To avoid that, I should like to ask\nyou to get 2 empty pipes of oil that have been boiled clean and firmly reinforced with hoops\nso that they do not leak. Fill them up with syrup and firmly close up the tops with nails so\nthey cannot be opened. They should get in safely, and I would then give you a good\ncommission, but they must be kept steady and above all the casks must be thick so that they\ndo not discover by leakage that it is not oil inside.

I see that you and Mr Hendrick\nThuen drank my health in a glass of wine: thank you for your kind remembrance of me, and\nas soon as Hendrick Thuen comes home again we shall drink your health in return.\n\nI see that Mr Thuen has been establishing a secure business for the Tar Company in\n[England], in which he will use you\u2014which I am very happy to learn.

I hope that\nMr Thuen has put things in good order in [England], as well as in Holland and other places.\n\nThank you for your kind offer to serve me whenever I have any goods to send, which I\nwill accept. I cannot overlook you since you have served me so well in the past, which\nencourages me to employ you further\u2014and I would have done so already if it were not that\niron has been at so low a price in [England] that I and others have been frightened off from\nsending any iron to [England]. For at \u00a3124 and \u00a313 per ton there is nothing to be done: it\nmust fetch \u00a314 to \u00a315, and then I might have something to send. I see that broad iron is\nfetching the highest price. It is important that I should know which kinds of iron are in most\ndemand and fetch the most money, so that I can have them made at my works. If 1 knew\nwhat price anchors were at in [England] I could yearly send you 100 to 200 slb. Here they cost\n30 to 32 copper dollars per shippound. I have about 80 slb of large anchor-flukes lying here,\nwhich I cannot easily sell. If 1 could sell them in [England] I would send them to you\u2014to\nwhich I await your reply.\n\nI and some other friends have decided to carry on an iron-works located in Varmland\nwhich can produce 2.000 to 3.000 slb of iron yearly and likewise 100 to 200 slb of copper at\nthe least. If the mine were extended it could well produce 300 to 500 slb of copper, but I\ncannot guarantee so large an amount until we see how the mine turns out, which one can do\nbetter when it is working. We will send the iron and copper to Gothenburg. When the works\nare in operation I shall probably have need of 3.000 to 5.000 RD at a low rate of interest. If\nyou were willing to accommodate me I could ensure that you receive large commissions.\nPlease send me your views on this as soon as possible, as well as the price of anchors and bar- iron. If I see any profit in them I shall send you some in the Spring. I look forward to your\nanswer on all this, with cordial greetings, &c.",

Isend you the treaty that\nyou may see the proviso of the [18th] Article? as also an extract of the other, but I have left\nout all words which ware between here and there to our prejudice, as that word tempore belli\nand the like.4 So that I think it the best to stay a day or 2 rather then to spoile the whole\nbusiness by too great an importunity.

However, we hope they have appeared by the time\nyou receive this.\n\nYou say that you see no chance of ships bought in Holland being granted freedom, since\nthe Resident, Lord Leyonbergh, put in a memorial to the King\u2019s Council about it and got the\nanswer that the laws of the land had to be obeyed. Nevertheless it is to be hoped that, with the\nhelp of the recent letter from the General College of Commerce, the Resident will obtain it.\nHad the English Resident here? not so firmly assured the College of Commerce of it we\nwould not have despatched the ships thither.\n\nYou also say that other people have been loading substantial quantities of pitch and tar\nwhich have arrived in England, and you tell us you would have been obliged if we had\nforewarned you about the amounts we had sold to other people for despatch thither\u2014to\nwhich we say that not a single last has been sold for despatch. We cannot find that any tar has\nbeen sent from here, but pitch certainly has, of which we have previously advised you. We\nwould be glad if you would tell us the captains\u2019 names and to whom the goods were sent.\n\nHerein we send the bill of lading of Capt. Hendrick Hoyer of the ship De Groene Jager,\ndestined for Hull and consigned to Mr William Skinner with 57 lasts and 4 tuns of tar and 30\nlasts of pitch. Please give further orders to Mr Skinner, and herein is a letter for Mr Skinner\nwhich you will please give him.\n\nMr Thuen has written to you that you should undercut your rivals\u2019 low prices, which is\nour view also, because if these people are allowed to undermine us they will finally get on top\nand domineer, so we think it is best to anticipate them and deprive them of the opportunity.\nPlease handle it carefully.\n\nCapt. Oloff Ericksen of the ship Halve Maen, which we have mentioned before, is now\nready and has on board 12 lasts of pitch and 31 lasts 5 tuns of tar. Please procure insurance on\nhim and on Hendrick Hoyer, according to contract.\n\nMr Simons has written to you that he must pay RD 6.000 for us and that he has to draw\nthat amount on you, but there is still some time to run so we have written to him to delay a\nlittle. For those amounts which he has already drawn on you and which you have accepted,\nplease honour them, but we had not intended to burden you before the arrival of the ships.\n\nYou will have learned from our previous letters that we have been unable to find the Lord\nTreasurer? at home in order to present him with your bill of exchange. By our next we hope\nto be able to tell you if he will accept it, though we fear payment will follow only slowly, but\nwe will carnestly press it and on receiving it place it on your account. But you have valued the\nrixdollar too high\u2014it ought to be only 4s 6d as the exchange with Hamburg does not yield any more. Remaining, &c.",

We hope to\nremit you the remainder by our next. We have made a note of the 20 sacks of pepper laden\nfor your account in the ships Gratia and Vrede, departing from Amsterdam, and of the 100\npieces of lead on the William & Elizabeth, half for your account and half for your brother-in-\nlaw, Mr John Lethieullier, from whom we have received the bill of lading. May the Lord\nbring them in safety. We shall not fail to press for the highest price possible. Lead is now\noffered at D.50 on delivery and for prompt delivery at D.503, but falling, for there are daily\nmore enticements to buy so that I fear there will be a further decline as this is also the deadest\nseason of the year for sales. Pepper is still being held at D.150, because there is not much in\ntown. If the Gratia arrives early I still hope to find a good market, but with one thing and\nanother I may not be able to do such good business. The Lantsman, according to the latest letters,\nhas not yet arrived at Leghorn\u2014I mean, Ancona. Indeed, he delays too long and [---]\nmust be taken. May the Lord protect him from mishap. Likewise with the Enropa, whose\ndeparture from Leghorn you will have seen in my last letter. As for the sale of lead, I cannot\nsay if it has been well done so far because, as yet, there is no better prospect to be hoped for. If\nit should increase further in England it may well go the same way here: one must hope so. As\nfor that which has just been laden in Amsterdam, and which will have to fetch a better price if\nit is not to produce a loss, I assure you that it will be dealt with as if it were my own.\nEnglish tin still remains here at the price of D.32 per hundred-weight (corresponding to\nthat of lead). If not too much more arrives we are of the opinion that it will remain at that\nprice, Zante currants were being held at R. pta. 40, Cephalonian at R. pta. 35 to the first\nbuyer, with the likelihood of not falling as there are still two or three ships to go there to load.\nIt will be possible to lade the new Apulian oil next month at D.134 per salm, for casks on\n\nboard.

I have received the account of\nthe 50 cases of stecl: I shall check it and debit you accordingly. It is very welcome news that\nPetersen Muller has arrived safely. I hope the other two ships from Gotland will also arrive\nsoon and that their timber will find a good market.\n\nI see that Jacob Grys is not permitted to unload his pitch and tar in [London]: for what\nreason, I would very gladly learn. I saw also that you were offered \u00a35 16s for the remaining\nlatten and that you sold it for \u00a35 18s. I urge you to you to do your best for my brass and\ncopper as if it were your own and that, if possible, you get it sold before the winter, because I\ncan send a new lot in the spring. With the remaining bars you should bide your time and take\ncare only to dispose of the small parcel of copper-wire rods. It is good garcopper of a kind\nwhich you can no longer get and without it one cannot make bars. I hope it will sell well. As\nall the ships are going to [Guinea?] it is not advisable to sell the bars at \u00a35 15s or even \u00a36. Itis\nbetter to bide your time. I have noted what is happening to iron.\n\nYou have now paid all the drafts from the Messrs Van Baerle. I would like a clear\nstatement of how much you think you will have at your disposal on my account from now\non, for my information.\n\nThe sample of kettles which you sent with Matthys Meyer has not yet appeared in\nStockholm. As soon as they arrive I shall let you know whether or not I can get them made,\nthough I think I can, and you will have my thanks. I want to know how much they cost and I\nwill place it to your credit. At 7s per cwt. the calamine is no use to me.\n\nYou can expect two more ships from Gotland laden with beams and planks. They will also\nhave a quantity of sandstone of the kind we use in this country to ornament our houses as\nchimney-pieces or fireplaces. I have ordered the captains to take it aboard as ballast beneath\nthe timber. If there is anything to be done with it I could deliver a great quantity. It was\nselling in Holland by the foot at 18, 19 and 20 stuivers per square foot, but while freight-rates\nare so high one cannot get as much for it as one ought, for it should cost at least 25 to 26\nstuivers per foot. I shall be glad to learn what happens. If there should be any major buildings,\nsuch as churches or mansions, being constructed in [London] and if one could make a contract\nfor a large quantity I would agree to it even if it were for as much as 30 or 40 ship-loads,\nprovided that they unload it. I could supply it, free-on-board, at 12 RD per 100 square feet\nand at [London] sell the best at 2 RD, provided that the buyer paid for the importing and\nexpenses in [London]. You could look into it with this trial offer and Iet me know your\nviews.\n\nI hear that large amounts of sheet-iron are being forged in Hamburg this year and sent to\n[London]. I beg you to let me know how much it may be selling for, what size and weight it\nis, and if further amounts are being demanded, for I could deliver a good quantity if there\nwere some profit to be made by it. And I want you also to inquire if it has been decided in\n[England] to have a copper coinage made, and if so, whether one could not deliver a quantity\nof copper blanks. Please find out, in secret, and let me know about it. One could earn a substantial commission on a commodity like that. Wherewith, my heartiest regards, &c.",

I beg you to do this, and not to\nlet it go for less than \u00a35 12s or \u00a35 10s.

The ships are called De Hartogh (of which Claes Jacobs is\ncaptain) and the St Margreta (captain, Cornelis Jacobsen) and I am having them loaded with\ntimber, such as large and small beams, planks and firewood. I am also putting some limestone\ninas ballast, just as an experiment. Very fine lime can be burned. You could enquire if there is\nany chance of selling it: for your information, one can get three tons of lime from one ton of\nlimestone. You will be hearing from Mr Jacob Kroes how much it costs. As for the timber\nwhich is coming in the above-mentioned ships, you will find it much better timber than any\nfrom the Baltic or Norway. Indeed, an English builder assured me that it was as good as any\nnorthern or Dutch oak. You will find it to be mostly of large beams, over one foot thick in\ndiameter, so I am hopeful it will sell for much more than it did last year. I am relying on you\nto do your utmost with them.\n\nI am also expecting at Klintchamn two large ships from Holland which will also be loaded\nfor [London] with extremely fine timber. They will be consigned to you and I do not doubt\nthat you will seck my profit. Please pay the freight charges to the aforesaid captains according\nto the account which Jacob Kroes will send you if he writes to you. If the timber-ware should\nfall short of the balance due on the freight (which I hope it will not) I shall make provision for\nyou from Sweden, I am relying on you, and if the timber sells well and if Dutch ships can\nfreely come to [England] with such goods next year I am thinking of sending 10 to 12 ships- lading of timber.

    "TEXT": "My latest letter to you was on the 29th past and since then I have heard nothing from you.\nThis serves to inform you that in September last I loaded in the Phoenix (Capt. Robert Clark,\nan Englishman) bound from here to Venice, 10 bales of pepper, bearing the mark adjoining,\nand 512 pieces of campeachy wood which weighed here 15.733 lb., as well as a quantity of\niron cannon-balls. I now learn that the said captain struck on the Goodwins and, having\nsuffered some damage, ran into Dover where he unloaded the whole ship and wrote to the\ninterested parties here asking for remittance of his expenses, which it is said will run high. So\nmy request to you asa friend is, that you will immediately write to your friend at Dover to\ndiscover what costs he has incurred and to urge him to have some regard for my goods. As for\npaying the costs of unloading and reloading, that can hardly be done unless a proper division\nis made, and I would judge it best that the captain tries to borrow the money and leaves the\ndivision of costs until he has delivered in Venice. Meanwhile, since it will be undoubtedly a\nlong voyage and I understand that pepper is fetching high prices in England I would be glad\nto see you receive the 10 bales of pepper and also the campeachy wood lying at Dover,\nagreeing with the captain for half the freight or, failing that, paying the whole freight and\nkeeping the expenses as low as possible. And if you can sell the pepper for 23d or 24d [p. lb.\nand the campeachy wood at about 50s [p. cwt.] please do it, and also find out how much that\ntype of cannon-ball fetches in England. I am sending you herewith the bill of lading, the\nendorsement left blank, as well as a letter to a passenger and friend of the captain and owners\nwho is now on the ship, called Henrig de Valet, who I am urging to persuade the captain to\nfollow your advice in all matters, as I trust he will do. There was also loaded here in the said\nship a small barrel of cardamon marked \u2018P.B.\u2019 which the captain said, on signing the bill of\nlading, he had not found. Please inquire if it has now been found in the process of unloading;\nif so, it can be sent on to Venice. I beg you to forgive me for giving you this trouble, and\nplease do your best to serve me, urging your trusted friend at Dover neither to lose the bill of\nlading nor to fill it in before it is known what the captain will allow to be done with the\ngoods. I am also sending herewith the bill of lading for the cannon-balls in case you need it\nand it seems a good idea not to reload them. I know very well that such goods as pepper and\n[campeachy] wood are not allowed to be imported into England from here; however, I hope\nthat in this regard no notice will be taken and that you will know just how far one can go.\n\nSir, as I found the cotton you sent reasonably good, excepting one bag which was very\ndirty inside, I herewith request you that if there is no prospect of further decline in that sort\nyou will, at your convenience, look for similarly good cotton and if you can encounter a\nquantity which is clean and white to be had for 6d to 64d then get me another 15 to 20 sacks of\nSmyrna, as well as 10 of Cyprus, cotton\u2014and if such clean and white stuff is to be had at 65d\nor 62d please buy it and send it at the first opportunity in the spring. Above all, you must\nprocure good quality, which can be done very conveniently since there is no prospect of a\nprice rise. I can see no opportunity here for poor quality, for your information.",

I\nwill gladly bear any loss, whether it arises in [England] or here, and I understand perfectly\nwell the difference between exchange and current money.

Regarding the sale of my iron with a rebate of 8 per\ncent\u2014I will gladly grant that, if you will stand liable for bad debts, but I think it is too risky\nfor me to bear bad debts in return for 6 per cent rebate on goods sold at 6 months time.

Consequently, one must be careful to whom one sells.\n\nThe \u00a3150 @ 35s 10g on Amsterdam remitted to Mr Bex for my account on 2 October at\ndouble usance drawn on John Lodge & Co has been accepted. I trust payment will follow, for\nwhich I have credited your account.\n\nI urge you to sell my iron which has come with Beursen to reliable people. As there is no\nfitting-out taking place in [England](3) demand is very small, so one must wait and see. I have\nhad a lot of inquiries after Beursen\u2019s iron from the English here but I did not want to let it get\ninto other hands. Please let me know in due course how things turn out with Scherley.

For the last 14 days the ice has been melting so that the Elbe is\nnearly entirely free of it, and yesterday the mussel-fishers started coming up again.\n\nI have been glad to see what Barbados sugar has been doing [in London]. The price of 27s is\nstill too high for me and since it seems likely to rise in [England] there is nothing to be done\nwith it here in the near future because there are too large amounts in too many hands of\npeople who would be glad to sell at 62 to 63g. But little is disposed of because our leading\nsugar-refiners provided themselves before the winter with such large stocks that for 6 months\nor more there will be no shortage. Consequently, unless its price weakens in [London] there\nwill be few orders from Amsterdam or from here. However, if it should show signs of falling\nto 245 or 245 6d please buy 15.000 to 20.000 lb. and send it to me. If you draw on me for the\nrequisite funds at once, due honour will be done to your bills, but above all see to it that it is\ndry and white or else leave it alone, for dirty, clammy stuff is of no use to me. Despite cotton\nbeing so cheap with you it would not be advisable for it to come here as there is no demand\nfor it. Oil was falling to \u00a329 with you: if you can get some clear, sweet Apulian oil which has\nfreshly arrived you can buy me 6 or 7 barrels, but take good care that there is no dirt in itand\nthat there has been nothing strong or bitter-tasting in the casks before. I would prefer you to\nbuy the best barrels, of 140 to 150 gallons, and send them here as above at the first\nopportunity. Galls here are at 42 to 43 ML @ 13 months time. 60s for them in [London] is too\nhigh. Large quantities have reached Marseille and they are cheap there so I consider that those in London are as high as they will be. Wherewith I commend you to God\u2019s protection, &c.",

There are no certain prices for many of the goods here, since none of them are selling,\nbut we must hope for better. There is a large quantity of galls in town, more than can be\ndisposed of in two years, and as people are expecting a ship from Marseille here with yet more\nLondon can expect no commissions for this commodity while the price remains so high.\nSugars have fallen to 63g and 64g which is a low price and it cannot be brought from\n[England] for less. We still have the two small consignments which you provided us with last\nyear, and we wish it would rise somewhat in [England] so that we could recover our capital\nand perhaps make a little profit. We shall be glad to hear what further developments there\nare, as well in Ardasse, indigo, ginger, oil and cotton. Other friends in [London] have\nreported to us that white Barbados cotton is at 6d. If you can obtain fine, clean, white goods\nyou may buy us 20 sacks and send them at the first opportunity, for the speediest despatch is\nrequired if it is to be sold at the Easter Leipzig fair.* Apulian oil fetches 72 RD per 820 lb., for cash; campeachy wood ML 30 per 100 lb.; white ginger 16g; black ditto, 129; wherewith, we\nremain, with friendliest regards, &c.\n\n[P.S.] You can draw on us for the cotton and it will be duly honoured.",

    "TEXT": "Our last letter was about a week ago; since then we have received yours of the 12th instant\nwith sundry enclosures for Sweden which have been forwarded. We have noted that the\nproceeds of the 4 casks of pans and kettles which came with Claes Scholts amounted to\n\u00a3251 14s,and that the 3 chests of latten, 4 casks of pans and kettles and one cask of pots which\ncame with Willem Muller yielded \u00a3440 4s 8d. As for the remaining copper rods and sheet-\ncopper from J[acob] M[omma] as well as the copper-wire from W[illem] M[omma] please\ndispose of as much as possible if the price recovers. We wait to learn if the 4 casks of W.M.\u2019s\npots which came with Andries Jornson have been sold. We shall postpone drawing on you\nfor J.M.\u2019s account until next month and then not more than \u00a3500 to \u00a3600 sterling in all, and\nif we can manage it we shall entirely forego drawing and expect you at your convenience to\nmake remittances for our friends in good bills. However, it is very awkward for us to be out\nof pocket for so long on account of the money we have advanced upon these goods since the\namount is so large.\n\nHerewith goes the account of the 40 barrels of tin received with Simon van Houten, of\nwhich the net proceeds amount to f.6.196.12s bank-money. We have placed it to your\ncurrent account. Please check it over and if you find no errors please approve it. We will not\nsell your remaining tin for less than f.58 until further order. So far no buyers have come\nforward for the galls although we have several times commissioned brokers. We shall\ncontinue to do so whenever we see the Opportunity.\n\nWe have made inquiry with Peter Simons\u2019 book-keeper as well as in the Bank to learn if\nthe \u00a3250 sterling bill of exchange of 1/11 January at 36s with double usance drawn by you\nfor the benefit of Jacob Cornelisen and endorsed to Widow Forkenbeck had been enrolled as\nhe said it had been when he wrote to you on the 12th inst., but from both we received the\nanswer that it had not been done. So, according to your request, we have today paid the sam\nto the aforesaid Widow Forkenbeck by declaration before a notary that it had been done for\nthe honour of the drawer, as appears in the deed accompanying the bill of exchange and\nprotest sent herewith, amounting with interest and expenses (according to the enclosed\n\naccount from Forckenbeck) to: f.2.708.16.00\n\nWe have today drawn on you \u00a3256 2s 6d sterling, payable at 2 usances to Gerard Weymans,\nthe value of Michiel Gerard junior, which you will please honour and set against the aforesaid\namount. We have also told Abraham Bex and Jan Aries Snoeck that we will pay the \u00a3110 @\n36s 3g and the \u00a344 4s 4d @ 36s on the date due, for which amount with expenses we will\nalso draw on you. The above-mentioned Simons has left for Sweden and has written to\nsomeone that he will be back within two months and will give everyone satisfaction. We too\nwere of the opinion that he did no business on his own account but we now find it was\notherwise and that he carried on a trade with Portugal, as well as with Sweden, in salt. In\naddition, during the war, he had taken shares in various Swedish ships with all of which he\nmade no profit. Yet he has advanced about f. 100.000 to various people in Sweden, for which\nhe expected goods in the spring, and as he had no means of his own he had to use other\npeople\u2019s money; and a broker whom he was accustomed to use failing not long ago several\namounts were called in and seeing that he could get no credit to make good the amounts\nwhich were drawn by him on Frankfort (being about 44.000) he decided to depart. His\noutstanding loans and assets nearly balance his liabilities, being about 200.000, but in the\nlatest letters from Sweden it is said he has had orders from the Tar Company to draw \u00a32.000\nsterling on you. We do not doubt that you enter into Swedish obligations carefully enough,\nbut we have been asked to believe that you yourself sometimes stand burdened with \u00a34.000\nto \u00a35.000 on account of the Tar Company over and above the value of the effects you have\nin your hands, which we cannot credit.\n\nHerewith we return the bills of exchange for \u00a3200 and \u00a3100 accepted by Daniel Planck.\nThe \u00a3100 on Van Racy remains still without acceptance for the reasons we explained in our\nlast. As the time is too short for it to be endorsed he has promised not to plead exception to\nthe endorsement so we shall protest if it is not settled at the due date.\n\nWith warm regards, &c.",

We cancelled the commission for Ardasse; this we now confirm. We\nhave since received your letter of the 9th inst., together with the account of the 10 butts of\nsugar sent with Capt. Willem Oloffsen and now received. We shall look it over and, finding\nno errors, will record our agreement. We have examined the weight in the casks and we find\nit turns out reasonably well, but we shall lose Soo lb. by the tare of the butts. The sugar suits us\nwell except that 2 butts turn out to be not so white as the other 8; that is our opinion. If we\nwrite to you for white and fine stuff you may get us something similar to the 8 butts in this\nconsignment which have turned out to be white without any brown or rusty stuff amongst it.\nPlease do not hesitate to pay 6d more, but for 1s more it must be extra-choice. Do your best\nfor us. Another friend writes us with this post that great quantities of sugar are expected from\nBarbados, and the more it declines in price the better you will be able to obtain it. Do your\nbest, because the profits between here and [England] are very meagre. Thus, if you can find\nan entirely fine batch you may buy us ro or 12 butts and send it here. We shall see if we can\nremit you a sum at short sight by the next post; if not, you may draw the amount on us and\nyour bills will be duly honoured as has been the \u00a3150 sterling which you drew on us at\n2 usances for the sugar, to pay to the order of Marselis van der Hulst.\n\nWe shall be glad to hear what further happens to this commodity as well as your opinion\nabout pepper. We are glad that you have bought us 24 sacks of Barbados cotton, big and\nsmall, at 4 3/4d [p. lb.]. We shall expect the account and your drafts. There is nothing to be done\nwith it here at present and if more comes from [England] it must decline further, for there is\nno consumption. We hope that you have not bought us any Ardasse for it has fallen greatly\nhere from 19s to 17s within 3 weeks. Therefore, please do not buy us any for we could make\nno profit with it.\n\nIf you buy Barbados indigo please see to it that it is saleable and of high quality, because\nweak, blue stuff is not required\u2014for your information. As long as galls are unobtainable in\n[London] for 46s or 47s it is no use thinking about them for the quantity here is too great and\n\nthey are very cheap.

I know perfectly well that a\nlarge quantity will not sell. I frequently sell quantities to Englishmen here who send it\nthemselves to [London], paying here for the purchase f.103 or f-11; they must then pay here\nfor an export licence and in [England] for its import, so if they can only sell for 20s they must\nbe very foolish. You must try to get the most you can.\n\nAccording to what you write sugar must now be at its lowest, and I would be favourably\ninclined to buy some, partly in order to dispose of the last lot I got from you\u2014which is still\nunsold\u2014at a somewhat lower price, and partly in order to mix that with somewhat better\nquality to make it appear more respectable for sale. But because of the way you served me last\ntime I am very apprehensive, fearing to get bad quality instead of good. If you can do better\nand obtain extra-good quality at 24s, then buy 30.000 to 40.000 lb., but get nothing other\nthan the very choicest for as I have already said it is only to serve to improve the appearance of\nthe other lot.! If you cannot get it to your satisfaction you must let it wait as it does not\nnecessarily have to be done today. You can distribute it in 2 or 3 ships and lade them here at\nthe earliest opportunity. I urge you most strongly to procure only the best quality, and see\nthat in weighing it my prescribed weights are observed.\n\nYou indicated ginger to be at 48s. If you can obtain good quality at that price, free on\nboard, please buy 8.000 to 10.000 lb. and send it here also. Cubeb, I understand, are selling at\n\u00a36 tos in [London]. If they can still be had for that you may also undertake the purchase of\n1.000 or 1.200 lb.

It is lamentable that such an\nimperishable commodity should be undersold, and if they continue to conduct themselves in\nthis way in [England] while large amounts are still coming things will go badly this year, for I\nsee that much has been shipped from here, but I trust that it comes into firm hands and\nremains there at a good price.\n\nYou will have learned from my previous letter what I have sent to you, and I hope the ship\nis now well out to sea\u2014God bring him soon in safety.

    "TEXT": "Our last letter to you was three weeks ago, to which we refer; since then we have received\nyours of the 11th and 18th past, to which this serves as a reply. You will do us a kindness if\nyou will show my lord Helmfeldt\u2019s son(1) all courtesy if he calls, for we do not doubt that\nbefore the receipt of this Teunis Clopstock and Pieter Klunder will have arrived safely at\n[London] as well as Swen Rassmussen at Bristol\u2014God willing! We commend to you the sale\nof our iron as if it were your own. Enclosed herewith is the bill of lading of further iron laden\nin the ship St Anna, captain Jacob Gries, vizt.:\n\n486 bars\u2014Slb. 69.9 ordinary fine iron\n424 bars\u2014Slb. 91.4 flat iron: together 160 Slb 13 lispound.\n\nYou will please insure it for RD 800\u2014that is to say, eight hundred rix-dollars\u2014with good\ninsurers, and kindly send us a little account of this as well as previous insurances made on\nClopstock, Klunder and Swen Rassmussen. We would have loaded more iron in the St Anna\nbut because of contrary winds it has not arrived. By our next letter we will advise what other\nbatches you can expect from here and from Gothenburg.\n\nConcerning the delivery of copper of which you were thinking, we are not much inclined\nto it and cannot make up our minds as copper is very dear here and at the price you\nmentioned it would render a poor account. It is rising daily so that one can make no firm\nestimate. We can probably do better by selling our wares here.\n\nWe were very surprised to learn of the serious situation of Mr Simons\u2019 affairs in\nAmsterdam. He had informed us otherwise when he was here, and we have learned nothing\nelse from him than that he had reached agreement with Mr Abraham Momma about how\nyou were to be reimbursed. We now hear the contrary. Since he had so many claims on the\nTar Company here he should have been able to obtain the necessary means, and we are\nheartily sorry that you are so deeply involved. God knows, we would have watched out\nbetter for you if we had known. You can expect a good quantity of iron from Gothenburg, although it is taking so long that one gets weary. Cordial regards, &c.\n\n[P.S.] Please give the enclosed open letter to captain Nils Anderson, skipper of the ship De\nWitte Duyve, freighted to you by the [Tar] Company and demand of him the freight money\nhe has earned and hold it until further disposition, and whatever the captain may need for the\nship\u2019s requirements you can let him have back.",

I have since received your very\nwelcome letter dated the 18th past, most of which is answered by my last letter and for the\nrest this will serve.\n\nRegarding what you proposed concerning a person who approached you about a\nconsignment of garcopper and \u2018Hungary plates\u2019, without specifying the quantity, and for\nwhich you quoted him the price of \u00a35 14s for the garcopper and \u00a36 for the Hungary\nplates\u2014in reply to which, I could not easily deliver it to [London] for less if I am to gain\nanything by it. Coppers have risen here because those abroad, as in Holland and Hamburg,\nare also somewhat raised in price. As a result, I cannot afford to take less, and that for cash\ndown or within 1 month of delivery, and you should please be prepared to allow me to draw\non you at double usance for at least three-quarters of the value of the cargo as soon as the bill\nof lading has been sent. If your friend can agree to these terms he can order as much as he\npleases\u2014but he must answer at once, otherwise the copper-markct here will be over and it\nwill be too late in the year to send anything out, for winter is nearly upon us. We shall\ntherefore await your, or your friend\u2019s, decision, but if we wait much longer nothing can be\ndone before the winter.\n\nConcerning my remaining wire, I urge you most strongly to dispose of it at the first\nopportunity, but I cannot agree to let it go for less than \u00a35 8s or \u00a35 9s.\n\nCoppers rise here daily and look likely to rise still higher, so I shall have very little profit on\nthe above-written conditions. If the market does not alter and I am to make a start I must\nquickly get moving.(2) Please let me know in reply to this the quantity of rods which\n[England] can consume yearly and at what times they are most in demand.\n\nMessrs Pels complain that you had their \u00a3200 bill of exchange protested on the grounds\nthat they had drawn \u00a330 or more than I had given order for. I am greatly astonished for I\nnever imagined that they had gone over the limit, and even if they had you might well have\nconsidered that it would not happen again and that I would have acknowledged the amount\nfor my account. I trust that for the present there will be enough time to procure payment of\n the amount. I urge you most strongly not to treat those gentlemen\u2019s bills with disrespect. Iremain, &c.",

Your letters of 25th past and 2nd inst. have now come to hand, in which we see that\nyou have given up the two warchouses at Deptford and two others at Blackwall, debiting us\nwith \u00a324 for their rent, and have leased two others at Blackwall for 3 years at \u00a350 per\nannum, of which we have made a note. It is a good thing that you have only hired two for the\nmoment. Whenever one needs more one can easily find the opportunity.\n\nWith the Company ships being unfree exports are going rather poorly, for the little schuits\ncan take in so little. We sent you a note a week ago about how much had so far been sent to all\nplaces, but a mistake was Padeabene captain Thomas Klerck where he is noted as having\n60 lasts of tar and 20 lasts of pitch whereas according to the accompanying bill of lading he\nhad taken in 27 9/13 lasts of tar and 15 lasts of pitch. Since then we have chartered two others for\n[England], that is\u2014captain Erick Anderson Brandt, of the schuit Fortuna, and captain\n[blank]. The former will have his cargo aboard within three days and the other, God willing,\nwill be cleared within eight days, so we hope to send the bills of lading by our next letter. We\nare doing our best to obtain further ships and think it not inexpedient to send another 1.000\nlasts of pitch and tar as soon as we find shipping for it, wherein we are doing our best and\nMissing no opportunity. '\n\nWe are unhappy to see that none of our ships have yet arrived. We hope the Lord will have\nbrought them in safety by now as the wind has been favourable for some time.\n\nWe have credited your account with the freight paid to captain Jurgen Kohne as well as\nwith the gross avarage. We also note that the cargo is sold. When it has been delivered we\nshall expect an account as well as our current account at your convenience. For the rest, we\nrepeat our request of a week ago that you will write to Mr Deutz at Amsterdam that you will\naccept for us \u00a32.000 stg. which we will draw on him at 6 months sight and he can draw on you. Meanwhile, before it falls due, nearly all the goods will have been sent out. We await\nyour answer hereon and commend you to the protection of the Lord, &c.",

My brother had the honour of\nsaluting you in [London] about one-and-a-half years ago with my cousin, Dominicus\nJuncker, and to inquire if we could establish a regular correspondence between us. I have been\ngreatly inclined to get a good quantity of Barbados sugar, but only of the finest and best\nquality of the sort you provided for my nephew Paul Berenberg. In procuring the purchase\nmake sure it is at a reasonable price and in the right condition\u2014especially if it reaches 22s or,\nat most, 23s. Also Barbados cotton at 4-pence and good Aleppo gall-nuts at 45-46s, as a\nfriend of mine says he has had, which are likely to be 46s. Please also tell me how much nice,\ndry English leather is fetching. Here it is at a very low price and I am sure it can only be at 6d\nin [England].\n\nFor some time I have been selling a good deal of linen alamodes to the English here, which is\napparently sent to Barbados and the colonies. Please find out in [London] how much a piece\nof 70 ells, 7/4 broad, would fetch, a sample of which is here enclosed and which I can have made\nin all kinds of fashions. If you also had the opportunity to dispose of about 100 barrels of tin,\nof the mark of the Horse, which is the best sort, I could provide it. If you cannot reach\nagreement in [London] you could take the tin barrels, which are RD 21 (I say, one and\ntwenty) free on board, and set against them a delivery of sugars and Barbados cotton (which\nmust be entirely good) and I shall set against it as much money as the tin is worth and you\ncould take the commission on both the tin and the sugars. I have arranged to do so with a\nfriend here and it has worked out well.

I have since\nreceived yours of the 25th and 29th of June, and 9th and 30th of July, the contents of which\nare fully understood and to which the answer shortly follows herewith.\n\nI have received the account of the iron sold from the Fortuyn and found it correct. I have\ndebited you with the proceeds, \u00a3325 11s 6d and credited you with the RD 140 from my\nlord Pistolhielm at 4s 9d each, being \u00a333 5s. The idea that I should be paid here at the rate of\n5s 6d is a mistake, for they can be got for no more than 5 10/32. [d.c.m.]\n\nI have seen what you write about the price of iron and other things, and it is annoying that\nsome dealers should undersell by offering it at \u00a314 per ton on delivery. They achieve nothing\nbut loss by doing so as they have bought it dearly here. I hope it remains at a good price so\nthat one will continue to want to send it. I expect to hear in due course.\n\nWith regard to what you write about charges on the iron I send to you, you are to\nunderstand it as we have done formerly, namely that for whatever expenditure you incur you\ncan take interest, and if any losses should occur\u2014which God forbid! it is well-insured and\nyou will recover your outlay from those gentlemen who have drawn on you for my account,\nso you run no risk and there is no need for you to make difficulties. It seems to me rather\nstrange, what you say you have written to Messrs Van Baerlc, that they should not draw on\nyou before the ship has reached [London]. If they are to fulfil my drafts on them they must be\nable to draw RD 2.500 on you. My request is that you will allow them to draw as much on\nyouas the proceeds approximately come to, though deducting what you may have advanced\nfor me already according to the accompanying account. And as regards what has happened, I\nhave looked into it and find that when the 158 barrels of steel were estimated to be worth\n\u00a3160(1) you were already about \u00a3340 out of pocket. Please let Messrs Van Baerle have any\nproceeds arising in excess of that amount. I depend on that as I have charged them with my\ndrafts and will draw accordingly on future deliveries.\n\nHere inclosed I send 3 bills of lading of iron laden for my account in the ship Mars, captain\nHans Johanson, together amounting to Slb. 872.10, including various sorts of \u2018English-style\u20192\nbar-iron and Slb. 117.15.10 of forged band-iron. NB that in future it must be sold at higher\nprices, as I have written to you before and to which I refer you. Herewith also is a bill of\nlading from Capt. Hendrick Claessen Boender for Slb. 305.15.10 of \u2018English-style\u2019 bar iron,\nall of which I am consigning to you, and I have another batch which will follow. In selling it I\nurge you to have as much regard for my profit as if it were your own: I depend upon it.\n\nI have read what you tell me about Peter Simons and am surprised that you did not write\nto meat once about what you let him draw on you. I never thought his affairs would turn out\nso badly, and as for me being indebted to him for f.8.00o\u2014I can prove the contrary as he\nowes me for Portuguese drafts, so I do not know how I can help you. I do not doubt that he\nwill try to satisfy you in full, as he has written to me, only you must enter into the agreement with him. God protect each and all from misfortune, &c.",

I had hoped\nthat the undercutters would not have moved in so suddenly.(1) It is much to be wished that this\ntrade could be brought into a few hands and by that means preserve its reputation. You will\nknow how to seek the most advantage for my consignments, which remain commended to\nyour care.\n\nAs the prospect of bringing some timber to [England] in foreign-built ships and getting\npasses for them has faded for the moment, we must let it pass until a better opportunity arises.\nI have still about 800 to 1.000 shippounds of iron standing ready which I intend to send in the\nship Jupiter unless some other shipping turns up so that I can divide the consignment, but I\nvery much hope that it will obtain a better price. At the present price I think it advisable to be\ncareful with my consignment and wait for some improvement. Then, I beg you, let the\nMessrs Van Baerle have what they need for my account. I am of the opinion that iron will not\nremain at such a low price, and would also be glad to know your views.\n\nHerewith goes the bill of lading of Hendrick Claessen Boender which I forgot to insert in\nthe foregoing.\n\nLet the Messrs Van Baerle have as much as the iron proceeds amount to, and I will make\ngood the interest on what you advance. The ship Mars is lying in harbour here and will sail\nout with the first good wind\u2014may God protect him.\n\nI have seen what you say about Mr Peter Simons and I am very sorry that it is so. There is\nlittle to be done with a procuration as, so far as I know, he has scarcely any effects here, and to\nset against those I must have my protested Portuguese bills of exchange so they will amount\nto very little. I wish you had sent to me in April or May\u2014I would have been able to do\nsomething but it is too late now and I must hope that he, Simons, will take good care to satisfy you.

We have been paid the \u00a3100 stg. at 355 11g drawn on John Lodge, and have\ncredited your account.\n\nWe are sorry to see that you are in dispute with the V\u00e4stervik Ship Company. Our friend\nat Rotterdam wrote us on the rith instant that he has sold another four 6-pounder cannon at\n[f]8: 15(1) on the same terms as the last, and as the guns are old and inferior we consider he has\ndone well. However, we have since then written to him to hold back from selling fora while,\n\nWe have taken expert advice about the sample of cotton but find that it is too coarse for\nEast Indian yarn and most resembles yarn from the Straits, of which there is at present a\nreasonable amount in town. The yarn sold by our East India Company is fine, like the\naccompanying sample, and sells at 28 to 27 s[tuivers] per lb. That which was sold at 16 1/2st was\nbadly made up and as a result it fetched less than others just as fine. But we judge that cotton\nyarn which is no coarser than your sample should sell for 16 st per lb., and you will please note\nthat the finest are the most sought after. Such yarn is mostly used at Haarlem for textiles and\nother stuffs,(?) and because little has arrived here this year from the East Indies we believe it\nwould not do badly if you could find something finer\u2014or certainly not coarser-\u2014than the\nsample you sent.\n\nWe see that the price of copper-wire has risen somewhat and is likely to continue to do so\nas little has been sent to London. We have noted how much of J. R[eenstierna]\u2019s wire has been\nsold, and we hope you will soon be able to close the account of W.M[omma]\u2019s copper-wire.\nWe have procured the necessary acceptance of the \u00a3935 12s 2d stg which you remitted to us\nin ten bills of exchange for my Lord Jacob Reenstierna\u2019s account and he has been informed of\nit.\n\nYou wrote to us about remittances being made against A. Reenstierna\u2019s iron on its arrival\nor earlier: as against the iron in Jacob Giese you have remitted \u00a31.000, since which have\narrived Jacob Jacobsen Grys with Slb. 152.14 and Claes Molt with Slb. 636.17, against which\nnothing has been remitted. Your next letters will possibly inform us further.\n\nPeter Simons is lying sick in bed. As his settlement has not yet been signed by as many\ncreditors as are required for it to take effect we suggest that you demand his guarantee in case\nthe remaining creditors refuse to sign and he is released from his obligations. What happens\nnext only time will tell.\n\nAs you ordered us not to hurry with remittances we shall return your accepted bills of\nexchange of \u00a3100 on Jean de Roy and \u00a3200 on Roelandt Cockey with our next\u2014\nwherewith our heartiest regards, &c.",

By our last you\nshould have had the bill of lading of Capt. Erick Fix, his cargo being 327 lasts of tar and 18\nlasts of pitch. We have given orders for the insurance thereon, as well as on Hans Johanson\nand Anders Krock, and wait to learn the result. Please also take care of the insurance,\naccording to contract, of Jacob Pieters Potteut\u2019s cargo, being 74 small lasts of tar and 39 lasts\nof pitch. Capt.

Jacob\nFix, which will be coming in for loading next week. Hans Reyser\u2019s ship was built in an un-\nfree place so we have not dared to load it.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Jacob Sempel has procured a recommendation from his Excellency the\nEnglish Ambassador for the free export of 150 lasts of pitch, since he has paid the Company\nfor permission, and the goods are all consigned to you. We have loaded 85 lasts of pitch for\nthat voyage, for your information.\n\nWe have examined the four sale-accounts of tar and pitch and found them correct and\ndebited you for the proceeds. We shall try our best to send 70 lasts of tar and 10 lasts of pitch\nto Yarmouth and 4o lasts of tar and 15 lasts of pitch to the Isle of Wight, but we see no chance\nof doing so as there are few native-built ships here and they have all been freighted for\n{England] by others; and as long as there is a shortage of goods in London we think it\ninadvisable to send them to the small places.\n\nWe note that you have been approached by two friends who want to buy 600 lasts of tar\nand 200 lasts of pitch to be delivered to them between now and March next, for which they\nhave offered \u00a384 and \u00a3114 respectively, payable in 6 months, with nothing for warchouse\nrent\u2014to which you await our answer.

But if your friends\nwant to be reasonable and pay the money on delivery we would not quibble about ten\nshillings.\n\nWe see you were obliged to pay \u00a3152 concerning the verdict in the water-balliage case,\nand you say you would be glad to know if you should spend something more to prevent the\ncase coming to a halt. If you believe it would help and see that something can be gained\nthereby we shall be glad to spend something more, but we could not agree to making our\nexpenses still bigger and then lose the whole sum. For the rest we leave it to you to do as you\njudge best and as you find matters stand.\n\nConcerning the case of Mr Peter Simons, we can truly say that nothing would please us\nmore than to assist you but there is not a penny to be got from him here, and we swear on our\nconscience that we are owed three times as much as you are, of which we see no chance of\ngetting a stuiver. He has given us his guarantee, but that is not money, and we do not see how that can help us, or you, in this business. We must break off here and commend you to God\u2019s\nprotection, &c.",

Please credit us, without prejudice, as\nif the money had come in, and if you check over the account and find it correct please make a\nnote of your concurrence. We are doing everything possible to dispose of the remaining 250\npieces of small lead from the Thomas and Francis, and although there are no buyers now at\nD.49 with 3 months credit we shall let no good opportunity pass.\n\nAs you will see at the foot of this letter} we have also sold the remaining 6 bales of pepper\nfrom the same ship, together with 21 from the Pearl which, God be praised! arrived here this\nweek with the Frederick. They took in a passenger at Zante who had been taken there from\nCandia, and as result they have been unable to obtain practica.\u2019 All the cargo has been sent to\nthe Lazaretto and the pepper as well must be re-packed in other sacks. This will cause further\nexpense, but as there is no other remedy we must be patient. If good purchasers make offers\nfor the remaining 4 sacks we shall take good care of it. We have been made offers for the first\nto arrive, which we believe will fetch a reasonable price. We understand it ought to be selling\nin [England] somewhat cheaper but we fear the quantity will pull the price down and we\nhope that that which your brother{-in-law] John LeTheullier and his friends intend to send\nwill be the first to come to market.\n\nThe best Stockholm tar in thin casks was lately sold here at D.42 per 1.000 lb. with 30 per\ncent tare for the casks. There is not so much demand from buyers for it in thick casks and it\nsells at D.4 per 1.000 lb. less with 33 per cent tare\u2014all gross weight. Any ship which comes\nfully laden with these goods, among others, enjoys freedom from the new impost on currants\nloaded at Zante.\n\nSome salted Irish salmon came with the Pearl for which no price has been established but\nwe imagine it will fetch about D.28 to D.30 per barrel. Barbados sugar is at D.6 per hundred-\nweight with 12 months discount. Spanish muscovadoes are at D.8 with 6 months discount.\nGallipoly oil is D.15\u00a7 free on board, and Zante currants have been bought at about R. pta. 29.\n\nBe assured that anything further you may be pleased to order will be dealt with as if your,\nand your friends\u2019, interests were as close to our hearts as our own. We remit you herewith\nanother D.1.200 as indicated at the foot of this letter.\u00a7 Please do the necessary and credit us\naccordingly. Herewith goes the second copy of the bill of exchange for D.100 remitted you\nby our previous letter.\n\nWe have sold the 100 pieces of lead from the Pearl at D.s0 with 4 months discount to Bortolo\nMassalini and it is now being unloaded and delivered to the buyer. This saves the expense of\nbringing it in. At the moment we see no prospect of improvement to judge by the demand of\nbuyers so far.",

We are at the moment in negotiation with another to go to [England]: with what\nsuccess we will tell you later.\n\nThe Lord God be praised for the arrival of Matthys Boriesen and Erick Anderson\u2014may\nHe bring the others in safety! It is good that you have been able to sell all the cargoes of the\nabove mentioned and we hope the rest will be similarly disposed of.\n\nConcerning the proposition of your two friends about buying 600 lasts of tar and 200 lasts\nof pitch, we refer you to our previous letter and would prefer to look for the highest possible\nprice, though if your friends would move little further and go up to \u00a39 and \u00a312 we would\nagree to it. The offer of \u00a383 and \u00a3114 is too little. [We are doing our best to bring it to the\nhighest price.](1)\n\nConcerning the case of the water balliage on which you seck our approval for spending\nmore. We urge you to do as you would for yourself, and if you see something to be gained by\nit we shall gladly spend more, but if it is a matter of spending yet more on an uncertainty and\nthen losing the case we would rather lose now than later, so we suggest that you do as you\nwould for yourself. The directors of the Vastervik Ship Company have probably forgotten\nto advise you about placing \u00a3177 15s 2d expenses on their account, but they entered in to it\nvoluntarily and in fairness they must do so because it is their case as much as ours. We shall\nspeak to them about it so that you can get instructions from them.\n\nBy our previous letter we asked you about giving Mr Deutz another \u00a32.000 stg. on top of\nthe first \u00a32.000 because we would be sending you as much or more in goods, and now you\nsay you have written to Mr Deutz that he could draw \u00a3200-\u00a3300\u2014by which you doubtless\nmean \u2018thousands\u2019. If that is the case, and if you will remit to hin as we requested, we most\ncordially thank you. He will not have done so yet, but we are very pleased that you have\nwritten to him and that you will duly honour his bills when he draws on you, though most of\nthe drafts we have made on him fall due in January and February. We hope you have taken\ncare of the insurance on all those ships as we ordered.\n\nAs we have said to you before, though with much regret, there is nothing here to be hoped\nfor from Peter Simons. It is very annoying that one must suffer loss for one\u2019s good will, but what can one do? We too think it is hard. We remain, &c.",

    "TEXT": "We find ourselves with your welcome letter of the 22nd past. In reply, we await your\nconvenience to know if, having received the accounts of the gor pieces of small lead and the\n100 pieces of great lead sold at Genoa, you have found them satisfactory. We send you\nherewith the account of the 250 pieces received from the Thomas & Francis, of which half the\nproceeds amounts to D.528 16g bank-money. Please credit us accordingly, without\nprejudice, while the money comes in, and after you have checked the account and found it\ncorrect please record your agreement. That commodity remains here still at D.48 because\nthere is plenty in town and the buyers are for the moment well-provided since\u2014God be\npraised\u2014the John & Thomas arrived here yesterday bringing another good quantity. But as\nthe price remains stable in England and apparently little more will be sent we hope it may\nimprove in price, particularly in the spring.\n\nThe 462 bars as well as the 17 casks of tin are being offered at the highest price possible, but\nwe regret that the 9 casks which we received earlier must be kept in the warehouse as the\nquantity does not suit the buyers. We hope the batch in the casks will do better and find a\nquicker sale. We will let you know how we fare in our next.\n\nWe see that you have loaded in the Providence, for your account, 50 bales of pepper and 75\npieces of great lead, and that Mr Lethieullier and other friends will load yet more, amounting\nto 300 bales of pepper and 450 pieces of lead. We thank you for your kindness in\nrecommending us to others and we shall not fail to do our duty, seeking at all times to sell\nquickly and at the highest price possible and making speedy returns to your friends. We hope\nto hear by your next that the ship has departed. May the Lord protect him from mishap and\ngive him a speedy arrival so that the pepper gets here before the candle-days.(1) Otherwise, the\nseason will be over. Many say that whoever arrives here before the others can expect to\nprofit, for undoubtedly the first to arrive will get the best prices.\n\nWe understand that The Brothers has also been consigned here with a large amount, and\nwas lying in the Downs on the point of departure, but as he must go and load the rest of his\ncargo with furs we hope the Providence will get here before him. We see that your friends then\nplan to procure returns in oil. The latter is selling at D.154 per salm, free on board, at\nGallipoly where it is better value than elsewhere in Apuglia and where most of it is loaded for\n[England] and other regions. At Bari it is fetching D.15} free on board, the measure there\nbeing about 6 per cent larger than at Gallipoly but the oil is of worse quality. One can get\nreasonably good oil at Taranto but we understand there are no good barrels to be obtained\nthere and the price of the oil is about the same as at Gallipoly, so in our opinion it would be\nbest to be provided there. The new oil should be clear by the end of January. It was ordered\nhere that a quarter of last year\u2019s oil should not be put on sale and the remainder kept at a high\nprice, but nevertheless it is the opinion of our friends that it may initially fall rather lower as\nlong as no large commissions are obtained. I believe the said ships will be able to lade the new\noil and think it might not be inadvisable to lade 20 lasts of heavy oil as ballast, as was tried last\nwith the Gratia, The oil was well-stowed and arrived with little leakage, and since the last of\noil is small we should be able to count on loading at least 700 salm or more, at 10 salms per last,\nas it is a ship of 160 tons. You and your friends can best decide what you judge to be advisable\nand order us to act accordingly.\n\nThere have been no further letters from Zante. The general opinion is that currants there\nwill cost more than R. pra. 32; on Cephalonia they are paying R. pta. 26 and 27. The John &\nThomas is also going there to fetch its lading and will need a pretty large amount.\n\nBarbados muscovado sugar\u2014D.6 with 12 months time; ditto from Lisbon\u2014D.6 with\n6 months. Pepper, since there is little or none left in town, sells at the second hand for D.84.\nVeronese rice D.18, with freight for Amsterdam f.65 per last. No change in other\ncommodities.\n\nWe remit you herewith D400 as detailed at the foot of this letter, for which please procure the needful and credit us accordingly. Wherewith our cordial regards, &c.\n\n[P.S.] D.400 at 54 3/8 d sterling drawn on Henry Mudd by Hailes & Ravenscroft. In the pepper\naccount there is a mistake: your 1/3 amounts to D.1.002 13g.

Meanwhile you would not do badly to sell all my remaining goods in your hands\nat the highest possible price so that we can close the account, and in the spring \u2014God\nwilling\u2014I can supply you with new goods. As for having more small rods made I shall take\nnote of what you wrote.\n\nI have credited you with 7s too little which you entered by mistake for the freight you paid\nto Jacob Grys. You will have learned already that I have assigned on you the \u00a3200 stg., which\nyou should have paid to Messrs Burckin & Evertsen, to pay to the order of Mr Anthony\nBruyn the elder, who will have sent the assignment to Mr Philip Pelt Emanuel \u2014which I beg\nyou to fulfil. As for the \u00a3296 stg. which you remitted to the Messrs Van Baerle for my\naccount on the 8th of October, I have already credited you with it on the advice of the Van\nBaerles\u2014as I informed you in my last letter.\n\nI have seen your reply about advancing money to help keep my copper-works going and I\nam grateful to you for being willing to pay the value of any goods of mine you have in my\nhands.\n\nMr Marescoe, I cannot neglect to advise you that I have been approached by others from\nwhom you have goods on commission that I should agree to join them in placing our\n[English] commissions in other hands. The reason is that you do not manage the expenses\nvery well and tend to make them rather too large. How much truth there is in that you can\nbest judge for yourself but I can only give you this friendly advice to serve as far as possible as\na warning of what to expect, for without it you could easily lose their commissions, especially\nthe principal commission for copper-ware and rods as well as of iron. I have delayed any such change, and but for that it would have happened. Wherewith, regards, &c.",

I had hoped\nwith time and God\u2019s blessing to recover myself and have done all that was possible but, as\ncredit has been very scarce in these troubled times and has finally deserted me, it has been\nnecessary to acquaint my creditors with my lack of means and as a demonstration of my\nhonesty I have decided neither to run away nor to trouble people further but have proffered\nmy books with all their debts to reveal my whole condition and to contribute all that still\nremains to me in the world to re-payment.

We have looked it\nover, found it correct and noted our agreement with you.\n\nWe see you have paid \u00a3100 sterling to Capt.

He shall repay the \u00a3100 here and it will then be\nremitted to you. The captain did it without instructions and had no reason to imagine that he\nneeded the money as our colleagues had taken care that he could get credit at Lisbon if he\nfound himself short for his salt cargo.\n\nWe see you have sold 238 bars of iron from Gothenburg at 135 6d p. cwt. That is good and\nwe urge you to keep our interests at heart with the remainder as the consignments sold this\nsummer have turned to poor account.\n\nThe Messrs Louis de la Bistrate & Jacob Frederick Dufay at Amsterdam advise us that they\nhave drawn \u00a3330 sterling on you, not doubting that you will have honoured these drafts as\nyou have previous orders and noted them on our account.\n\nTrade has finished here for the year and the sea and all rivers can only be traversed with\nhorse and sledge, and there is a great shortage of water at the works so there will not be much\niron ready for the spring. We suggest therefore that you hold on to our remaining iron, for\nthe market must rise.\n\nAs for the \u00a3100 which you gave to the captain of the St Anna on the credit of his salt cargo\nwe shall, as we said above, make you a remittance as soon as it arrives. The captain had no\nneed to trouble you. The price at which the iron has been sold in Bristol is disgraceful\u2014it\nwould have been better to sell it here.

It put Marescoe\u2019s\nliabilities for 635 2/13 lasts of tar and 286 lasts of pitch, despatched but not sold, at \u00a35.463; for quantities already sold,\n\u00a31.064 3s. Against this it credited him with \u00a3895 3s 1d, but Marescoe's note of sums owing to him for pitch and\ntar sold to 14 clients by 20 January 1670 puts the total outstanding at \u00a36,952 17s 10d.",
    "TEXT": "Our last letter was about a week ago, to which we refer, and since then we have received\nnothing from you. In our foregoing letter we said of Capt. Jan Pietersen that he had run into\nBoswyck in order to repair his ship, but the leak was nothing serious and was soon mended\nand he has since gone to sea again, so we hope to hear of his arrival soon. Meanwhile, a week\nago, we made a note of the insurance you made upon him and have credited your account\nwith \u00a322 6s 7d for the premium and expenses. We long to hear that you have also taken care\nof the insurance on the ships following, and with regard to that we refer you to our preceding\nletter.\n\nConcerning the advance of money on our goods according to contract, we send herein a\ndetailed account\" specifying how much they amount to. As we have repeatedly told you, we\nhave to make good that total to Mr Joseph Deutz on whom we have drawn RD 30.000, but\nMr Deutz says that he has not yet had full agreement from you as to the sum which you will\naccept, and that you will only accept as much as the goods in your hands amount to. But that\nwas not the intention of the contract which clearly states, in the words of the 5th article, that\nwhenever the Company sends the bill of lading for any pitch or tar and gives orders for it to\nbe insured, then the Company may draw or have drawn on you for each last of tar \u00a35 and for\neach last of pitch \u00a38, which you promised to accept and pay. So we again request you to\nmake good and pay Deutz the sums specified in the above-mentioned statement when he\ndraws on you, because the time is approaching when our bills on him fall due. We shall let\nDeutz know that he can proceed with assurance, for we would lose his respect if we gave any\norders contrary to the terms of our contract. Our credit would plunge steeply and you can be\nsure that he would not be so ready to take our bills in future. Therefore we must show him that he can get his reimbursement from you, or anyone else. We await your reply with quiet\nconfidence, breaking off here with our best wishes, &c.",

Since then I have safely received\nyours of the 31st [December] and am surprised to see that you had not received my latest, I\nhave received all your letters and am delighted to learn of Hans Heeren\u2019s safe arrival \u2014the\ngood Lord be praised!\n\nTo your news, that the pitch and the linen are safe in the warehouse awaiting buyers, that\nyou have sold some pitch at \u00a312 per last payable in 8 months time, and that you hope to geta\nstill higher price I say in reply that I heartily wish you had not sold it at such long time, for a\nlot of mishaps can occur during 8 months. I beg you asa friend not to sell at such long time if\npossible, and I do not doubt that it will suit you to do so seeing that you are content to do\nwithout double commission. Besides, it will breed more business. I long to know what is\nhappening and I wish with all my heart to hear from you regarding the linen and to know\nwhat we can do with it. If the price yields something I shall send you 1.000 pieces or more\nevery year, as long as consumption is that large, and I shall not seek any exceptional profit as\nlong as I can cover my costs, because between here and N\u00fcrnberg we are making a loss. My\nbrother-in-law is on the point of departure for places like Linz where the linen comes from\nand where he will obtain another consignment. We wait to hear what you think about\nsending another batch as soon as the rivers unfreeze. As regards the wool, it still remains\nunsold but we have had offers from an Englishman here who will make a deal for it, half in\ncash and half in goods. As wool remains at 15 per lb. I am not sure what to do. If, at your\nconvenience, you could inform me at what prices silk stockings and all kinds of men\u2019s and\nwomen\u2019s stockings are selling I shall see if I shall have some bought.\n\nSome days ago Joris Schrodering, a member of one of our great houses,(1) went out of\nbusiness and two days ago killed himself in depression, causing the failure of George Mattzen\nas a result of many great suspicions. He had served many important merchants on\ncommission, but I am involved only to the extent of t barrel of N\u00fcrnberg-ware, a remnant of\neight years\u2019 dealings. Things are very bad here.\n\nYou were perhaps corresponding with the Swedish Treasurer, Borgh Oloffson\nCronenberg, in Stockholm? He has been dismissed and so have Generals Wilhelm\nDrakenhielm and Starrenflicht. Hinrich Thuen is now the Royal Treasurer and people are\nnow making great efforts to find ways of serving him.(2)\n\nSince times are so bad here I shall make use of your offer of help and may well draw \u00a3125\nor \u00a3150 on you in my next letter, as long as you will advance the money at 3 per cent per\nmonth until my goods are sold to that amount. I beg you to accept my bills and wish you a\nprosperous New Year,\n\n&c",

I hope to see the account soon.\n\nI have also noted what has been happening with that person concerning the 60 tons to be\ndelivered at Stockholm, free on board, The proposal will certainly not suit me. I would not\nwant to deliver it to an English ship for only \u00a312 because the customs liability on each\nshippound would amount to about a quarter of that, quite apart from the Sound Toll which\nwill be at least 150 RD. And as for going to France to fetch salt and bringing it to Stockholm,\nthat will not do because there is no demand for French salt in Sweden and there would be no\nreturn from the investment, It is better to drop the whole idea until May when the amount of\niron coming in will increase. No ships can leave Sweden before then because I doubt that\nthere have been more than four days of thaw so far.\n\nIf your friend tries to go looking for a cargo for his ship in the manner you describe his ship\nwould be at least half-pawned(1) before it came home again. I would not advise him to go to\nSweden with an English ship: the difference in duties is too great.\n\nThe bill of lading for the remaining pan iron which we have here was sent to you by the last letter. The captain is quite ready to go but the low water prevents him from leaving, with\nwhich I remain, &c.",

Regarding the\npurchase of a quantity of indigo, I have been unable to make up my mind since that\ncommodity is in declining demand, and I also understand that great deceits have been found\ninside the sealed boxes which have come from [England] and some batches have been found\nto be extremely oily. Sugar also will do no wonders here notwithstanding the fact that there\nis little obtainable in [England]. Large amounts are coming from Portugal and just now \u00a7\nships, mostly laden with it, have arrived from Oporto. The ships which are expected daily\nfrom Spain will also not fail to provide good quantities of indigo, so I can see no advantage in\nbringing these two commodities from [England] unless they should come to very moderate\nprices on the arrival of the Caribbean ships. If there should be some change, especially in\nsugar, I shall be glad to participate. Ginger has been in some demand here but since substantial\namounts have arrived in [England] and more are expected it should soon fall in price. Cottons\nwill do no wonders here for the moment, though little may come this year; pepper seems not\nyet to be at its lowest level, and galls\u2014as I have said before\u2014will not rise for the present.

I wish you would send me an exact list of the duties on all\nimported Swedish wares for my guidance. As for the rest of my wire, I hope you will soon\ndispose of it so that I can close the account. As for the wire I had at Stockholm, since I could\nnot load it in the ship freighted by Cronstr\u00f6m and as no other opportunity arose, I let it go to\nHamburg.\n\nThe inland waters are just beginning to thaw and so the goods from up-country can now\nbegin to come down.

And please write and tell me whether or not latten is used by your copper-\nsmiths, so that I can act accordingly. At Amsterdam they consume at least 200 to 300 slb and I\nam sure you could use as much.\n\nBecause of floodwater we have not been able to work for the last two or three wecks, but it\nis now beginning to fall.

I have received the sale account, examined it, found it correct and debited you\nwith the net proceeds of \u00a3188 8s 3d stg. which you mentioned in your letter, without\nprejudice. As you know perfectly well, the 3 per cent which you charge me relates to the sale\nof iron and to the remittance of bills of exchange as well, as was agreed with the late Mr\nMarescoe. You have undertaken to continue on the same conditions which you have\nconfirmed in several letters, though I can quite believe that you did so precipitately. You will\nhave debited the \u00a34 11s 0d for the 20 bars which Anders Beursen delivered short, although\nsince I have received some information from the Crown galley I expect to be able to make\ngood some of it.\n\nI have credited you with 30s for the blue waistcoat. I have received 150 slb of iron out of\nVarmland, but as it is of only ordinary quality I have not wanted to send it but thought of\nusing it as ballast in our ships and sending it to Portugal where it can make RD 8 per slb. Pitch\nhas fallen into diverse hands here and is exported to [England] by various people and then\nundersold. I have spoken to several and told them that a friend of mine wanted to lay out\nsome money, but what can I say, seeing that there are various \u2018cladders\u2019 here who also want to\ndo so. The same thing is beginning to happen with iron. There are some who, for cash down,\nare selling at 8 or even 12s l\u00fcb. per slb below the ordinary price. It is also falling in price in\nHamburg. If I can get it to Portugal before these others there might be no great loss\u2014time\nwill tell.\n\nIt is a good thing that the new duties in [England] on iron and other wares will not\ncommence this year. The King here has also been thinking of raising the duty by 16 stuivers\nper slb, though so far it has not been done, but some small ships have had their exemption\ntaken away and must now pay 8 stuivers more per slb, though the King has been petitioned\nabout it. If any changes should occur we shall learn in due course.\n\nI have obtained acceptance of the \u00a3100 remitted to Bex at Rotterdam at 36s 1g and today I\ngot news from the widow of Libert Wolters that you had remitted her \u00a3188 for my account\nin two bills at 35s 3g, for which acceptance has been procured. I shall be glad to learn soon\nfrom Mr Bex what remains to be remitted to Amsterdam.\n\nAnders Beursen arrived here over three weeks ago without delivering to me the basket\nwith 24 bottles of Spanish Canary. Before your letter of the 21st of April came the basket was\ndelivered to someone else who thought that Jan Kreuger had sent it to him, and the customs\nofficial and some others have enjoyed some of the bottles. Nevertheless you have my thanks,\nseeing that there is no other way of demonstrating my gratitude from this country-town.\nWherewith, my regards, &c.",

And although you say that no bad debts need be expected to arise from the sale of these\ngoods, we trust that the debt duc from the widow Birckhead(1) will be collected and that you\nwill confirm that we run no risk concerning any debt arising from the said Reenstierna\u2019s\ngoods and that we need expect no retrospective demands or re-drafts. In that case we can\nallow the remaining advance to be credited to Reenstierna and paid according to his order.\n\nMr Willem Momma wrote to us some time ago, that he was disinclined to send goods to\nLondon because of the poor prices and the length of time it took to recover debts; and Lord\nReenstierna no longer sends any goods at our disposal to other places, in order (we believe) to\nsave the commission-charges. And because of the hostility between this country and France\nhe is sending much of his output to Hamburg where there is better business than here.\n\nWe understand that the Lord Cronstr\u00f6m was here for only a few days before returning;\nMr Louis Wolters is still here but is returning to Hamburg shortly, and it is believed that Mr\nLibert Wolters will then be coming back here.

Thanks to your letters I fully understand what has been happening to trade [in\nLondon]. Business here is poor in general and as a result I have not had the courage to order\nanything and I am all the more reluctant because goods are so cheap that a good deal of\ncheating is going on by mixing bad stuff with the good. I have had proof of that by several\nconsignments from you, the latest being with the campeachy wood which was not packed as\nit should have been. Every day I have to hear much complaint about it and there are many\npeople in this city who will certainly never buy any more from me. It lacks any colour, as if it\nhad been ground and boiled out completely, just as one finds it when it has been baked in\nsome great fire. In short, you have badly encumbered me, which makes me reluctant to order\nanything more. Today the East India Company are selling their goods in [London]. There is\nnothing to be done with pepper as it is so abundant that it is being undersold and will only\nyield a loss. Barbados sugar is definitely not required now that muscovadoes are so cheap that\none can buy them for 8g in current money with 13 months to pay.

I see that it is now down to 20s in [London] and that is for good quality.\nInshort, I have no relish for any just now. However, I shall meanwhile expect a note now and\nagain saying what is happening to that and other commodities. Oil has risen again here, but\nbecause I have been badly served by you on two occasions I am afraid to acquire any. It has\nsoared from RD 52 to 62.

I certainly never restricted you to any price so you\nought to have been able to get hold of it as you promised. I have every reason to complain\nabout you in this way. What is the point of writing to me with every letter that you had made\na note about buying for me at the current price and in the meantime doing nothing about it?\nYou can judge for yourself whether you have done well for me or badly. If you had complied\nwith my order and bought white ginger it would have turned out very well because this sort\nof ginger is very scarce here and dear, so I am extremely vexed that you wasted this excellent\nopportunity and instead of white bought me black. However, I suppose I must have patience\nand credit you with the 20 sacks of brown ginger at 47s, 5 butts and 6 puncheons at 48s, and\nabout 110 sacks at sos. I have made a note of them and trust that this batch will turn out to be\nexceptionally fine since you have paid such an exceptionally high price for it. Brown ginger is\nat a standstill here; there is plenty in stock and no demand. I shall expect an invoice and a bill\nof lading as soon as all my ginger is shipped, and I hope you have divided it between two ships. As for indigo and campeachy wood, you had better leave them alone. I must break off\nin haste, and cordially commend you to God\u2019s protection, &c.\n\n[P.S.] If you can get choice white ginger for 72s, or for 75s at the most, please buy me about\n3.000 lb. and send them here as soon as you can. I shall remit you the money and make good\nyour outlay. As the East [India] Company has had its sale I think the exchange will fall\nconsiderably. Wherewith again, adieu.",

The ship is now entirely unloaded and is\nlying ready to depart, only it lacks a good cargo and nothing has appeared so far except\n40 tons of currants to be shipped to England from Zante, but as that is too little we have not\nundertaken it.

I understand that my brother is offended\nthat you allowed his bills of exchange to be protested. What reason you had for doing that I\ndo not know.

Having heard nothing from you this letter will\nbe brief and serves mainly to accompany the second copy of the bill for \u00a3250, in case you\nhave lost the first. We hope you will have got it accepted and promptly paid when due\u2014but\nif not, you will know how to get it protested in [London]. Enclosed herewith goes a letter to\nthe said Momma which you will please have passed on to him and procure an answer. Our\nfriends, Paulus and David van Stetten of Augsburg, correspond with this Momma and\nremitted him some money towards the purchase of some goods (which we think were furs)\nand for some posts they have had no letter from him. In his last letter he wrote that he was\ngoing into the country because he was unwell but that as soon as he was better, the following\nweek, he would be coming back to town. So they are afraid that he may have died or that his\nbusiness is in a bad way, and have asked us to write to our correspondents about it to inform\nthem about his condition and to draw on him \u00a3250 sterling as he still owes them \u00a3300 stg.\u2014\nall which we have done in our previous letter, sending you the bill of exchange and enjoining\nyou to do what was necessary. The Messrs Van Stetten, who are such great friends of ours\nthat we cannot refuse them, now further request us to warn our friends in [England] in case\nthis Abraham Momma, with his business in a bad way, does not accept the bill of exchange\nthough the goods which they ordered have not been sent. In that event, they have sent us the\nenclosed power of attorney written in Latin, wherein they give us complete authority to act\non their behalf and settle matters with him, together with a clause allowing us to substitute\nwhoever we want where they have left our name blank, in case it should be necessary. So we\nhave substituted your name, to demand an account from the estate of the said Momma on\nbehalf of the Messrs Van Stetten. You must forgive us for taking this liberty but since we\nhave no other correspondents in [London] we could not call upon anyone else. We shall be\ngreatly obliged to you and will wait for you to send your expenses and other charges\nregarding this business. It may be that the man is perfectly well and there is nothing to worry\nabout, in which case it will not be necessary to the use the power of attorney, but please hold\nit in [London] until further order. Meanwhile, keep us informed how matters stand,\nforgiving us for the trouble. Keep a separate note of the postage of these letters so that we can\nrecover it from our friends.\n\nAs regards trade, we know of little to say. If war should break out between France and the\nDutch we believe there will be changes in the prices of many goods. Ginger is at a standstill.\nWe have checked the account of the 41 sacks of black ginger, found it correct and recorded\nour agreement. We now await the bill of lading. The wind continues steadily east so no ships\ncan come and Jacob Giese will also be driven back should God allow him to continue his\njourney. This commodity is too high in price, one should keep one\u2019s hands clear of it. As we\nsaid in our last letter, we want no more ginger or indigo. The price of sugar has increased a\nlittle and if you can obtain a good batch you may spend 22 to 22 1/2s. We shall now wait to hear\nwhat you advise. Fine Barbados cotton is no use to us at more than 4 1/2d. We shall be glad to\nhear whenever the ships arrive from the Levant at what price galls are offered, as well as\nArdasse, fine camel yarn, Smyrna or Acre cotton and also what further developments there are with indigo and ginger.

From the last I understand that the insurance on the ship Het\nGraefelyck Huys de la Gardie has been completed for \u00a3900 at 4 per cent, \u00a3250 at 5 per cent\nand \u00a3350 at 6 per cent, amounting with expenses and commission to \u00a379 18s, for which I\nhave credited you. In view of the high premium I trust the ship will have arrived in safety\nwith the others. I could not order any insurance from you before the cargo was loaded\nand I also believe that nobody else has insured except my brother Jacob. I trust the goods\nwill sell as they ought. Copper has risen to RD.76 at Hamburg, and brass ought to fetch\nproportionately. It is true, as you say, that while goods are coming in such abundance the\nretailers ought not to see the extent to which they come. Even more, this ought to be kept in\nmind by the wholesalers who ought not to sell for less than it costs to make. Otherwise it\nwould be better for the works to close down, just as those at L\u00fcbeck and Hamburg must now\ndo, for while they get only 6 to 8 rixdollars per slb more than the present price of brass they\ncannot keep on going. So it is only you who can alter things, and I repeat what I have said\nbefore\u2014I would rather that you leave goods unsold for 6 months than sell them for 6 months\ncredit.\n\nI have no doubt that you will do your best for me. As for the farthings, I have said before\nthat it is a most damaging contract for the Cronstr\u00f6ms, as well as for all others who have\ncontracted to deliver copper or plates. I would not have sent the last lot of latten unless it had\nbeen convenient to send with the other goods, and as the amount is not large it will be easily\nused up by the copper-smiths.\n\nHerewith I have drawn on you 6 bills to pay \u00a3750 to my sons Isaac and Jacob Momma or\norder at the end of February\u2014one of \u00a3200, one of \u00a3150 and four each of \u00a3 100\u2014which you\nwill please accept and return to them so they can use them whenever they need them.\nNothing remains but to send you heartiest regards, &c.",

    "TEXT": "Our most recent letter was by the last post, in which we told you not only to buy us 4.000 to\n5.000 lb. of good, white scraped ginger at the best price possible but that the black ginger had\nbetter be left alone since the price was running so high, and that if you bought Barbados\nindigo it must be absolutely choice and saleable stuff.\nIn this letter we only want to say that there have been no letters from London today so we\ndo not know if any changes are occurring in commodities. We want to know in your next\nletter what you have been able to do for us regarding the white, scraped ginger. As for the\nblack, we shall think about it for a while since the price is too high and the sale of it begins to\ndiminish, so the price will fall again as it is already beginning to do. With regard to galls,\neverything is very quiet; as for cotton and Ardasse, there is no demand. Of indigo we hope\nyou have bought us nothing since you must have also heard in [England] of the arrival of the\nflota in Spain, very richly laden with great quantities of indigo and campeachy wood. For\npeople well know that when great amounts of some merchandize arrive the price always falls.\nDoubtless you have considered that, and we shall be glad to hear that before you saw this\nletter you had not bought us any. Please leave it alone since there is no profit to be got from it.\n\nWe find that the most recent letters mention Barbados sugars as being at 21 1/2 to 21s, by\nwhich they think they must be at their lowest; but we doubt that, because there is so little\nconsumption of refined sugar and unrefined is in such poor demand that there is a rebate of\n8 2/3 per cent on 5 1/4g in current or common money (which differs by 4 1/2 per cent from bank\nmoney) which is a miserable price. We do not think it has ever been as low as 5 1/2g banco\nbefore, except for a short while before leaping strongly upwards. And we recall that it was\nonce at 20s and 19 1/2s in [London] and the exchange was more favourable than it is now, so it\nmay well fall back to 20s or below, which would not be strange in view of the high rate of\nexchange and poor sales through lack of consumption. Seeing in the latest letters that 5 or 6\nships from Barbados were unloading, take the risk of finding for us a nice little consignment\nof really choice stuff, which must not be dirty, and if you can get it for 21s 6d at the highest,\nfree on board, you may buy us ro butts and send it here under our usual mark. Once before\nwe had a batch which was in small barrels of about 300 lb. per barrel, which was very white\nand completely dry: we would be glad to have similar, or even better, goods. Ordinary\ncoarse stuff is no use to us, even for 20s or below; we have fixed the price rather high in order\nto have good quality. You may watch out for us to see if you can obtain such a fine\nconsignment of 10.000 to 11.000 lb. but if it is not obtainable, let it go.\n\nWe remit with this, for our account, \u00a3200 stg. at 2 usances and [blank] days in a bill of\nSamuel Free payable by Mr William Robinson. Please procure the necessary and let it serve towards the purchase of our goods. Wherewith we send you our most cordial regards, &c.",

Indeed, it really must be done because that commodity is daily held at D.100 to D.103\nwithout any prospect of abatement. These wars endanger shipping to such an extent that\nnothing can be brought from [England] or Holland without great risk. If France fails to\nobtain the pepper which is known to have just arrived at Lisbon in the ship from the East\nIndies it is likely to come to Italy which may well cause some fall in prices since this country is\nwell-supplied with it and it is only these troubles which stiffen the price. But if the war\ncontinues for long and the only pepper coming to Italy comes out of France the price may rise\nhigher, which God forbid!\n\nThere is no change in the price of lead apart from the last purchases we informed you of.\nSince then it has been at D.70 but there are no buyers and there is a large amount in town.\nTherefore, on the arrival of the Blackmore (which God grant may arrive soon in safety) we\nthink it advisable to dispose of your so pieces at the highest possible price. We do not see any\nprospect of any great alteration in the immediate future. At Leghorn it fetches D.314, which\nis much less than here. We will be glad to hear from you about this, if you think it\nworthwhile. Large quantities of lead are being brought from Germany now and are selling at\nD.70.\n\nSince you have procured acceptance of the D.235 which we remitted to you we do not\ndoubt that you will be duly paid. As soon as the rest of what is due on your account is received\nwe shall remit it immediately. Bortolo Marinoni owes for lead which came from the Coninck\nDavid. We have presssed him diligently and will let you know when we succeed. The\nSommission which came from Lisbon with sugar is loading oil here. Muscovado sugar fetches\nD.8 3/4 with 4 months time; powdered sugars D.12 to D.14, according to quality. There is very\nlittle left in town in the wholesalers\u2019 hands since it has been mostly bought up by engrossers.\nBarbados sugar, D.6; pepper-powder, D.11 with 10 per cent tare; oil at Gallipoli is D.13 1/3 free on board.

And as our iron- and wire-works are very\nburdensome and we are overloaded with iron and wire which we cannot turn into money in\nthese difficult times, we request that you give us sympathetic support in these circumstances\nand accommodate us as far as you can without prejudicing yourselves\u2014i.e. by allowing us to\ndraw on you for 8 or 10 months the balance to which our goods amounts to, payable to the\norder of Manoel Teixera. He can oblige us, and we have formed a special friendship with\nhim.\n\nWe calculate that the amount of iron, including what is in the ship De Patientia (which,\nGod permitting, will have arrived before this)\nIf we could now draw RD 7,000 as we have\nbefore it would be an act of great friendship, and as for the remainder we would reckon it as\nthe RD 2,500 due from the Lord Leyonbergh. Next week the following will be cleared,\nnamely: an obligation dated 27 July from Abraham Wolters to pay at 6 months for\nRD 397.25; also an assignment on the bank to pay on 29 November 2,400 dollars copper\nmoney, and 3,409 dollars copper money to be paid in cash. The rest will be paid next week\nwith an obligation from Caspar Robbert though without prejudice to us. Of these, the\nobligation from Abraham Wolters has come in and the others from Caspar Robbert and the\nbank.\n\nWe have seen with nothing but great astonishment what you say about our wire, which is\nnevertheless in as great demand here and in Holland, Hamburg and France as any other. We\nbeg you to take the proceeds, for the difference is quite considerable, and they must be wicked\npeople who refer to it in this way. We urge you to take care of our interests.\n\nAs regards the seizure of the ship De Dolphin, Mr Caspar Robbert will write to you more\nfully, and the King has got the Admiralty to write to the envoy Leyonbergh about the\ngoods.(1) I again commend to you the reclamation of my small consignment, since it is hardly\nimportant enough for the envoy to do it. If the Lord permits you may easily procure my half, for it is only some varnish which I need for my house, wherewith our cordial regards, &c.\n[P.S.] We have spent about RD.50, and we hope that it will be acceptable to you to rely on\nyour discretion in our difficulties.",

We wish so too, but we really\ncannot believe there is any chance of gaining anything, for the times are becoming too\ndangerous and everywhere there is fear of war, asa result of which very little is being bought\nand one can no longer recommend any firm price for commodities. We have never before\nwitnessed such bad times, and because so many Barbados ships have been captured at sea there\nis much undercutting of Barbados goods, so one simply cannot compete with them to make\nit worth paying out any money.\n\nIt is a good thing that you made a note to buy for us \u00a3200 stg.-worth of good black ginger\n(if it can be had at 40s or below, free on board) as well as 20 sacks of fine Aleppo galls, if they\ncan be had for sos per cwt. However, as galls are standing at 53 to 54s it is no use thinking that\nanything can be done with them. However, some other friends of ours hold out the hope that\nbrown ginger may well fall to 38s. You will know how to procure them advantageously for\nus, and when you have done so divide them between two Hamburger or other free ships and\nsend them here, giving us due notice by which captain they are sent\u2014but please do not send\nthem in English ships.\n\nSince indigo seems likely to be at reasonable prices please also buy for us about \u00a3130 stg.~\nworth of fine Jamaican or Caribbean indigo which looks saleable and of high quality, if you\ncan get it for 3s 1dor 3s 2d at most, free on board. And please make sure that it is not of small,\ndirty pieces to which people strongly object: a weak blue is of no use to us. You can send it to\nus here under our customary mark. Pepper still fetches 162g here but vendors are happy to\ndeliver it for 16g at 6 months time and good quantities are sold. The world is full of pepper\nand demand is very small. We shall have to wait and see; we believe it may perhaps be sold\nmore cheaply by some individuals, or it may stay at the same price\u2014time will tell.\n\n20 to 215 for sugar is certainly not dear although there is nothing to be done with it here.\nNevertheless, if we had room in our own houses we would order some but they are full up\nwith goods and unless we hire a warehouse, which is very expensive here, we can not have\nany. We are also well-supplied with Ardasse and it is cheaper here than in [England].\nMeanwhile we shall be glad to learn more about what is happening with one thing or another so that we can act accordingly.

I hope you have since been able to procure the remainder.\nI have also received the current account which you closed on the 13th of August by which\nthere is due to you \u00a35.237 15s 8d. lagree with that, but find that you have brought together\ninto the outstanding debts due on recent sales old debts amounting to \u00a31.594 16s 2d. New\ndebts cannot be mixed up with old debts. I also find that Anthony Hatch, Skepper, Slutter(1)\nand Sampson delay somewhat. I hope they have paid up since then, and please ensure that no\nnew debts are put down with the old ones. Also, specify how much each person owes\nwithout lumping together two or three persons unless they are in partnership and the one is\nliable for the other. Prices are bad and insurance costly so it does not help to make bad debts.\nPlease take care therefore, as you have until now. You seem to believe that my goods have\nbeen fully drawn against so I must calculate according to your own account what brass has\nbeen sent to you,\n\nIt is true that the iron ought not to be included in the calculation because it is not insured, but\nwithout the same it would not differ by more than \u00a3100\u2014\u00a3200, if you have accepted the\n\u00a3800 which has just been drawn on Gerret Laurens. The great decline in prices goes beyond\nwhat I had expected, and I had hoped to have \u00a3400\u2014\u00a3 500 more in proceeds in hand. Ido not\ndoubt that you will accept this \u00a3800 as well as what I have drawn against the goods in Erick\nAnderson Boy. You can expect no more this year. My view is that your prices are now at\ntheir lowest point and that with winter coming they will begin to fetch more.\n\nI have noted that you sold, in addition to the 250 coils of wire on 2 August to Wathing &\nWoodfield, another 350 coils to the same, all at \u00a36 tos with 4 months time; to John Skepper\n20 brewing-plates, cwt. 10.1.8 lb, of pots at \u00a36 10s and 12 cwt. of latten at \u00a36 with\n6 months time; and to Grice the remaining pots from the Jupiter as well as 23 cwt. of latten at\n\u00a36 10s in 6 months, and this account you have put with the outstanding debts due on the old\naccount.\n\nI have now received by the last post in my sons\u2019 letters news that Capt. Jacob Grys was\nintercepted and brought in to Rotterdam by capers, although I hope he will soon be released\nas petitioned for, Ifnot, it would be advisable if you sent over the policy on the brass, which is\ninsured only against the risks of the sea, with a simple attestation that the iron is not insured.\nMy sons will probably have written to you about it.

Nevertheless, as I really see no present\nprospect of much improvement I am forced to think that one must go along with it. I trust\nthat with these low prices the said iron will now sell rather better and in the coming year fetch\nrather more once it is better known.\n\nRegarding the accounts of these ships: I cannot see that much iron of importance will be\nshipped out of Sweden to London. It is not merely because of these low prices, heavy freight-\ncharges and expenses but also because there are no more ships to lade, all the large ships\nhaving been already despatched. It looks as if the increase in the toll will be set aside. I have\nreceived news from the Sound that Capt. Hendrick Mattson has arrived safely there\u2014for\nwhich the Lord be thanked.

On board is [the body of] the\ncaptain who was drowned at [the Isle of] Wight, so it is being conveyed by the mate, and as\nhe is unknown to me please be helpful to him and do what he may want you to do and receive\nthe freight money.

I am writing to him herewith to follow your orders in every particular. Please let me\n\nknow at once how much it costs to export from Bordeaux. He wrote to me from Bordeaux\nthat he was well and had agreed upon 42s per vat.\n\nPeople are trying to persuade me (although I simply cannot understand it) that Swedish\nships must state in their passes where they are going to and what they are carrying. That may\nwell be true if they are coming from Stockholm, but if they are sailing for other places it is\nquite impossible, because they cannot know what country they are going to before they have\nacquired a cargo, and by then it is too late to write for a pass. Please let me know how you\nunderstand it, and whether or not a captain, sailing from Stockholm to London with a pass\nsaying he is coming with pitch and tar from Stockholm to London, may then sail with the\nsame pass from London to Bordeaux and from there back to London or Hamburg?\n\nHerewith comes a note from Johannes de Geer about the iron he has sent you this year.\nThe ship Drie Salmen, captain Jan Cornelis, is likely to come here from Stockholm, being\nloaded there with iron and 528 coils of copper-wire by Johannes de Geer and Abraham\nWouters and consigned to Steven de Geer. Allin all, it has 2.732 slb of iron and 49 slb of wire.\nPlease have it registered in London as well as in Scotland if you judge it likely to journey\nthere. The ship De Coning David, captain Hendrick Matson, with its cargo of timber taken\naboard in Norway for the ship\u2019s account, is to sail to either Bordeaux or Lis as the captai\nthinks advisable. aie ee ete orders to enquire if there are any letters paces\nfor him if he should be driven into the Downs by contrary winds, so that if by chance\ntimber\u2014that is, deals\u2014are expensive with you and likely to fetch much more than at\nBordeaux, then he might as well go to London. So please write to your agent to keep an eye\nopen for the said captain, and decide whether you consider it a good idea for the cargo to be\nunloaded in London, or in Portsmouth or [the Isle of] Wight, where it might sell readily and\na return freight of bottles? for Bordeaux might present itself. Please deliberate with the\ncaptain about what might be best to do. Furthermore, I strongly urge upon you the\nreclamation of my goods in the Muscovite ship,(4) of which I send the invoice for your fuller\ninformation. I trust that everything is in hand and that you, through your agents, will be able\nto recover them. The expenditure which I mentioned previously you will know best how to\nmanage and bestow as time and opportunity permits.\n\nHerewith also goes a note to Lord Leyonberg which will likewise be useful, as occasion\nserves.\n\nOur Ambassadors have arrived safely at Rotterdam. I am thinking of going to The Hague shortly and if anything of importance turns up I shall let you know. May the Lord give us a\ngood peace, to whose protection I commend you, &c.",

    "TEXT": "Since my departure from Stockholm about a fortnight ago I have found here several of your\nletters, some written in partnership as well as individually. However, I have seen, not without\ngreat shock and astonishment, that you have neither honoured my drafts nor Mr Beck\u2019s,\nwhich is in direct contradiction of your own letter in which you wrote that you would not\nsatisfy the \u00a31.700 to Mr Neltorp(1) but that I could expect to draw \u00a31.000 on you at 2, 4 and\n6 months time. I have now followed your instructions and given orders to Mr Beck in\nHamburg to draw that much on you. Now comes your latest letter, refusing payment! As I\nwrote to you, with my resources otherwise disposed I really do not know how I am to\ninterpret this, and I cannot guess what you intend by it. I certainly intend to have control over\nthings myself, so I must ask you, in the friendliest way, to let me know at once how much of\nmy resources are disposed of and to whom, so that I can have a balanced account. I must tell\nyou, truthfully, I do not know where I am, standing here between two fires. I proceeded on\nthe basis of your letters and arranged my plans accordingly, but\u2014God help me\u2014find myself\nmistaken, so that I am thrown off my bearings.(2) You have truly done me a great wrong by\nthis, for which I must appeal to God. I beg you, just let me know how my assets have been\ndisposed of and whether they can be recovered. Whether or not you have paid others without\norders you will know best; I do not know, because I employed you as my agent. When, for\nthe first time, you would not pay the money to Mr Neltorp it was much the same as\nprotesting the bill of exchange, and after that you gave me instructions to draw up to \u00a31.000\non you, which I did, and gave you no other orders except to satisfy Mr Beck. If you have paid\nmoney to anyone else it is without any instructions from me and is no concern of mine. It is\nquite unreasonable that a Christian man should let down another in such a way, and it is not\nthe way that merchants behave. You have not the least right in the world to control my\nmoney as you think fit, without my orders. Be assured, this has struck me so hard that I and\nmy whole house could be ruined by it, for which you will have to answer severely before\nGod. My servant in Scotland informs me that he too will remit to you for my account, if you\ngive order to draw upon him, \u00a3300 and afterwards more. I request you then to send me an\naccount of how much is owing to me and how much I can draw on you, for I cannot now\ncontinue my journey before I have your answer. Patience! I have no doubt that you will show\nsome Christian kindness and consider how I am dealt with since I rely so much on your letter; and now, since it is so entirely out of my hands, I must leave off. I shall look forward to your\nanswer at the earliest, and remain, with regards, &c.\n\n[P.S.] I beg you, on the receipt of this letter to give Mr Beck order that he may draw on you,\nor that you will immediately remit as much money as is due to him, for before that is done I\ncannot set out on my journey or pursue my plans.

I have since received yours of the 18th and 29th of December, by which I see that you\nhave bought for my account 1 bale of Ardasse at 10s 6d on condition that I can receive the\ndrawback of half the customs duty, which\u2014according to you\u2014means that it will cost me\nabout ros 4d net. But that is quite expensive enough, and I fail to see that you have looked out\nfor my interests in making this purchase, for others tell me that they can get good Smyrna\nArdasse at 10s, and Aleppo at 9s 9d, which differs considerably from your purchase. This is\nnot the way to go about things. You say that it is worth 4d more than usual: time will tell\u2014\nparticularly if it were re-sold in England and you were able to make 4d above the current\nprice which you paid for it! But you say in your last letter that, in the event of re-export, I can\nrecover half the customs-duty, so it must follow that if it remains over there I can recover\nnothing, and so I cannot discover what advantage you have obtained. I also cannot see what\nreason you had to make this purchase so hastily, since you yourself say that the ships were not\nyet unloaded. With your next letter I shall expect the account so that I can make a record of\nit\u2014for there is no remedy for what is done, and one must be patient.\n\nGod be praised, Capt. Boys Ipsen arrived here some days ago, as you will have heard from\nothers. I shall procure the delivery of the bales! which you sent and let you know how I find\nthem in my next. Since you loaded nothing more in him there is nothing else of yours for\nwhich he needs to sign. You did well not to buy anything more of this kind since it is being\nmaintained at a quite indecently high price, and if one makes a purchase disadvantageously\none cannot expect any great profit. But I do not understand why you say that you want to\nbuy 2 further bales of Begbesar, because I have given no new order for Begbesar since the\n2 bales sent with Ipsen were bought, so please buy nothing. But, if the 2 bales of superfine\nAngora have not been obtained yet, please buy them as best you can though not for more\nthan 5s or 5s 6d, or in their place get 2 of the ordinary fineness of the kind sent with Hendrick\nWeever, for although it is not entirely white it is good and very similar and I used to prefer to\nuse it. However, as you say there is no lack of it, it is best that I leave you to use your own\n\njudgement. It is not freezing here yet, so\u2014God permitting \u2014W. Oloffsen can still get here,\nand I should be glad to have my 2 bales of Angora.\n\nEnclosed herewith goes the second copy of the bill of exchange for \u00a3100, payable by\nCaspar Kaus on the last day of this month and endorsed for payment to you. Please procure\npayment in due course and place it to my account. As for what is to be done with it\u2014I mean\nto say, with regard to other things\u2014it is good that the whale-fins are still unsold. They\nshould fetch more next spring since this week (God help us) four train-oil refineries were\ncaught in the fire and, together with much equipment and train-oil, 100.000 lb. of whale-fins\nwere destroyed, the damage being estimated at about RD 50.000. May God comfort the\nafflicted. This misfortune will not make that commodity any cheaper in [England]. Please let\nme know how much duty you were able to recover on the first consignment of whale-fins\nand add to it what you agreed on for warchouse rent, so that I can make a note of it, for I\nwould rather not confuse it with the other consignment. Since indigo is likely to fall it is good\nthat you are not in a hurry to buy any. As for the proceeds of the whale-fins, I shall let you\nknow in a later letter what I have decided to do with them. I hope you have also been cautious\nin going about to procure a parcel of white, scraped ginger for it seems likely to fall further in\nprice. You can see that sooner than I can and will surely have acted accordingly.\n\nThank you for the news about the [doicapi?] of Naples\u2014it will be most useful.\n\nI hope you have sent my current account. If not, let it be done. Thank you for your New Year wishes and may God confirm them in return. With hearty regards, &c.\n\n[P.S.] The \u00a3150 drawn by you payable to the brothers Du Pr\u00e9 falls due on the 3rd instant,\nbut since the Bank is closed as usual from the end of December to the 14th instant it cannot be\npaid any earlier but it will then be promptly done, unless you hear otherwise.

It has been freezing hard there for 4 or 5 days\nbut if they had the sort of weather we have been having they should soon be in open-water\nagain, and from the Sound they write that the winter is already past.\n\nI very much doubt that it will come to open war between Sweden and this country.

I trust that ours will have reached\nthe coast, but from the principal mining-areas there will be little, for they must first make up\ntheir stores, if they can be obtained while the winter continues.\n\nI hope Claus Wiens has arrived safely with you and that, regarding Momma, you are not\nout of pocket in salvaging the consignment from the St Jean.

In view of what you say I shall expect to see soon the account of my iron as well as\nremittances, and if they have not fallen due yet please advance it at interest.\n\nI am astonished that you should say that that sort of iron is not in much demand in\n[England]. Please explain the reason to me, for it was well forged of good materials. I have\ncontracted to deliver some consignments in the spring so if there is something which can be\ndone with them in [England] I shall send an assortment of such kinds as you may be kind\nenough to inform me of.\n\nRegarding the drafts from France on [London] and from [London] on Hamburg or\nAmsterdam as mentioned in my letter of 4 November, I know that double provision and\nbrokerage was promised, but against that it ought to be observed that from here to Hamburg\nand Amsterdam the course of exchange is usually 3, 4, 5 and 6 per cent higher than in the\nspring. We have found this over many years of dealing with one another, and if we then get\nthem to purchase in France during the winter and then draw at 2 usances, as is customary, on\nHamburg or Amsterdam, this way we can provide very speedy remittances from here. If it is\ndone through [London] then the time is prolonged for 2 months and in the spring it is\nimmediately remitted from here by the advantageous exchange, by which means the\nprovision and brokerage are abundantly gained. Last year the course of exchange at short\nsight was 21 ML on Hamburg, payable in banco, and at 193 on Amsterdam, payable in cash.\nWe have now drawn good sums at 224 ML on Hamburg and at 202 on Amsterdam. I am\nthinking of getting a quantity of miscellaneous goods bought in France this winter, for cash.\nIf I decide to allow them to draw on [London] I shall inform you in good time who it is you\nare to collect their reimbursement from, and I firmly rely on you for a punctual performance.\n\n[P.S.] Please address the letter for me here to Mr Hendrick van Felde at Hamburg so they can\nquickly get to me at Amsterdam.

Doubtless wire manufactures will sell more readily soon, if that\nwhich has been lying here all winter and is now all shipped meets with no further hindrance.\nBut as they cannot leave before we have found convoyers and are certain how things stand\nwith Holland and Denmark, nothing will be going from here, and so far we have heard little\nof English shipping.

I have decided to unload what I have lying here in 2 ships and to send\nit to Hamburg in order to gain time. I shall then urge M. de la Bistrate to do everything\npossible as diligently as he can to get it into your hands.\n\nAs you say, the confusion in Mr Willem Momma\u2019s affairs is working to the disadvantage\nof the brass-trade and is quite unhelpful, but he will never again be as strong as he was. I have\nsold my iron to a reliable friend here and so I do not export it anymore, but I could do so for\nthe copper bars if the Guinea Company will make up its mind. However, as it cannot be sent\nin that name or with any security for shipping this summer, unless in English ships, I shall\nhave to arrange things so that either itis sold and paid for here or else my trustworthy friend\nin Hamburg will have to accept drafts against the credit of the bills of lading \u2014provided that I\nrun no further risk once it is loaded free on board ship. And I should have to demand RD 60\nfor each Swedish shippound which would work out at about \u00a3 [blank], and then there is no need for 5 per cent for advance of money, etc. I wait to hear what the Company will offer and\nremain, &c.",

Indeed you have done well to make this\nagreement because I am confident that a substantial amount of that variety will be forged this\nwinter. As regards the other condition, you can rest assured that I shall deliver just as good\nvoyage iron as before and it will be others who will suffer the most loss for bringing my iron\ninto disrepute. This year I shall deliver 200 tons and perhaps even more, including the\nconsignment in the Coninck David, and I will certainly deliver the whole amount this year,\nbut I cannot bind myself so precisely to the delivery-date\u2014namely, the end of August,\nespecially because there is at present a general stoppage of all shipping. Ships are not allowed\nto depart, which is why the Coninck David is still lying here. I have about 200 tons lying ready\nat present, and when the quantity in the Coninck David arrives you can include it in the\naccount for the contracted 100 tons. I shall load the rest in the first ship for [London] and for\nthe future I propose that when I signify by bill of lading that I have loaded the iron in due\ntime I shall have fulfilled my obligation because I cannot be answerable if ships are held up by\nembargoes, long detours or otherwise. Please have that put into the agreement.\n\nBy your next I hope to hear that the iron in Claus Wiens has been sold.\n\nRegarding Mr Perman\u2019s bond, I find that it is in the requisite form. It is customary in this\ncountry to use no other ceremony in making a bond than to authenticate it with the person\u2019s\nsignature and seal without using any witnesses. If there is an error in the pledge regarding the\nname of Mr Leyel it cannot prejudice it, since the bond is essentially sound. I shall therefore not speak to Mr Perman unless he again asks you that I should do so. If there is anything\nfurther in which I can serve you I shall be happy to do so, since I am your servant, &c.",

This I confirm. Since then I have received yours of the 18th inst. together with the\nbill of lading for the bale of Ardasse and 2 bales of Turkish yarn loaded in Sybrant Clacsen\u2019s\nship.

As for the\nwhale-fins, I expect the account by your next letter so that I can see how much I shall have\nlost. I really believe the purchaser must be well-satisfied, for they were of good quality.\nRegarding the Swedish copper-wire of the brands you named, as far as I can learn there\nshould be about 3.000 coils in town, and the said brands fetch 61 to 62 ML per 100 lb, for cash.\nIf any change should occur I shall not neglect to let you know. For freight charges from\nL\u00fcbeck one pays 3 to 34 ML per 300 lb., less or rather more, according to the total weight.\nWhat charges there are at L\u00fcbeck I shall write at once to find out and let you know in my\nnext letter. Meanwhile, I believe they are inconsiderable though I cannot say how much\nmore the route via L\u00fcbeck costs compared with that by sea. But it is certain that, of copper-\nwares, copper-wire scldom comes here from Sweden by way of sea but rather by way of\nL\u00fcbeck and Wismar. It may be useful for you to know that Wismar is further from here than\nL\u00fcbeck and that people believe it will be besieged by the Elector of Brandenburg since he has\ntotally routed the Swedish army, capturing much artillery and all its baggage.(1) In sum, the\narmy is totally destroyed and, according to what they write, the general, some other great\nmen and the French minister, the Duc de Vitri,(2) only narrowly escaped. This will change\npeople\u2019s ideas: the suspicion which I mentioned before has vanished away, God be praised.\nIf I can be of any service in expediting the purchase of wire or other goods, please just ask\nme to gratify your commands, assuring you that it will be done as advantageously as possible.\nThank you for news of the prices of sundry goods. As regards sugar, I shall tell you in my\nnext letter whether I am inclined to purchase any. I estimate that you should have about \u00a360\nin hand if all my remittances are received together, which you will please employ on fine\nwhite scraped ginger. Please see to it that it is extra-fine. That which you last sent is plump\nand good but lacks lustre and it does not look white. Get if for me at the most advantageous\nprice.\nThe exchange on [London] continues to be high, so I have remitted nothing to you. I hope it will fall.

This letter will serve\nonly to enquire what chance there is of obtaining shipping-space in [London] and if two ships\ncould be found which, at 4.000 lb. to the last, will sail to Stockholm and return here loaded\nwith iron, and also what difference it would make between sailing from Stockholm to here or\nto [London]? Both ships should be of 90 or 100 lasts, or else one of 180-190 lasts as long as it is\nobtainable at a reasonable rate. The English are asking 34 to 35 per last here, which is a very\ngreat deal. I await your reply at the earliest.\n\nI have been negotiating today with Steven de Geer about supplying a ship which he has\nlying here, of 110 lasts burthen. If you could find a suitable man in an English ship who could\nsail as captain we could easily find the rest of the crew here because there are plenty of\nEnglishmen to be had. If this can be done please give De Geer orders to buy for youa ship of\nidentical size and, at the first opportunity, send over the captain for a voyage to Stockholm.\nConcerning the money for the purchase of the ship, you will give it on bottomry. If you need\nthe name of the ship in order to put it in the pass, it is called the St Jacob. De Geer also has a big\ngalliot which he will transfer on the same basis, to which your speediest answer is awaited as well as your opinion concerning the business of Pym.

Consequently our iron\nremains on shore, which we did not know about. It is lucky that we did not have it insured:\nour friends must have forgotten to inform us about it and, because of the rupture between\nthat kingdom and this state, dare not write fully because of the penalties on Dutch property\nthere. However, we wrote to Mr Uppendorff at Hamburg who informed us that you had a\ncommission from our friends in Stockholm for chartering a ship or ships to go and fetch away\nthe goods at Stockholm, and that consequently we must learn from you how things stand. If\nyou can give us some further information concerning this please communicate with us and,\nbecause of the present conjuncture, arrange with our friends in Stockholm to take our iron in\nyour own name and correspond with them as if it were on your own account. From the bills\nof lading already sent to you you will be able to see what it amounts to, and when you receive\nour iron please do your utmost to procure its sale, as if it were your own.\n\nFurthermore, we thank you very much for your good and exact information about what\nhas been happening to commodities. We could wish that times were better so that we could\ntake pleasure in speculating profitably in something. We hear that on the gth of this month\nthe sale of East India goods by your Company was postponed until 4 o\u2019clock on the 21st\ninstant. Here too our [East India Company] directors write that the day of the sale of a\nquantity of East India goods has been definitely fixed. You will undoubtedly have received a\nlist of the cargoes of the ships which have arrived. Goods are pouring in, pell-mell, whatever\nthe demand. Pepper ought to sell cheaply from the Company: it now fetches 14 3/8g; cloves,\n86st., nutmegs, 58st., fine cinnamon, 80st., indigo guatemalo in boxes, 6 1/2st., fine cochineal,\n30s, campeachy wood, f.8 1/2, and Aleppo galls f.33.\n\nNothing much is happening in Swedish goods\u2014copper-wire f.57 1/2, garcopper, f.57, for\ncash; Swedish fine iron f.6 1/4 \u2014 3/8, ditto Orgrond f.6 3/4 to f.7; coarse or anchor iron fetches\n\nWe wish we had the opportunity of being of service to you. Enclosed herein are two letters\nfor you from Hamburg received from Sweden. The Lord Hendrick Thuen-Rosenstr\u00e9m\nwrites us to send with his enclosed letter the bill of lading for 42 slb of wire consigned to you,\non which he says we may draw up to RD 2.200 which he has to furnish us with by the 12th\nand 19th of October. And he says we should correspond with you about what measures to\ntake to ensure for him the cheapest remittances from [London] or drafts from here on\n[London]. Regarding this we shall wait to see your answer to know what we may do.\n\nThe first convoy from Greenland has arrived here and in their company eleven ships bring\nwith them 1274 whales, which is a good catch considering there are not more than eleven\nships in the convoy. And in Hamburg the latest letters say that two ships have arrived which\nonly had 5 whales cach, so many people conjecture that in general their catch is not large\u2014\ntime will tell. Meanwhile it is believed that in September, October and November the new train-oil will be available at f.27 1/2, and fins at f.38\u201438 1/2. We remain, &c.",

Affin que les choses\nque nous arresterons demeurent constantes, tant pour ce quy est desja vendu que pour\nl'advenir, que sy ne desirez agreer cette proposition soyez assure que cela n\u2019empeschera pas\nque je n\u2019aye tousjours un soin particulier de ne faire mauvaise debtes et que je ne procure vos\nintherests comme sy l\u2019estoit pour moy mesme. Vous vous pleignez que le terme de 4 mois est\nun peu trop long: vous pouvez croire que sy javois peu obtenir plus court terme je l\u2019aurois\nfait mais je n\u2019ay pas creu quand on a affaire a des debiteurs qu\u2019on estime bons qu\u2019on doibve\nrompre un marche pour un mois de temps plus ou moins. On ne scauroit garder les\nmarchandises en magazin qu'un mois ou deux se treuve insensiblement escoul\u00e9 et quand il se\npresente marchand il faut encor accorder autant de temps pour le payement comme ona\ndemande au commencement. Le principal est de prendre garde aux debiteurs quy soient\nd\u2019entiere satisfaction.\n\nJe m\u2019informeray de la diference qu\u2019en fait icy entre les marques de la tulippe, de l' 'www/AW'\n\nmarque, de la [---?]M, et de l\u2019 'N' pour vous l\u2019adviser s\u2019il ce peut encore au pied de cette. Les\nchaudrons de cuivre jaune ont est\u00e9 icy autre fois bonne marchandises, mais sont a present fort\ndemeurez et ne se vend que a des chaudronniers dont la plus part sont tres mauvais payeurs,\nainsy je ne serois vous conseiller de n\u2019envoyer de grande parties, seullement un thonneau ou\ndeux pour essay, et sy vous y voyez de profit allons on pourra continuer d\u2019en envoyer plus\ngrande parties. Je vous ay dit que les droits de romaine pour l\u2019entr\u00e9e sont \u00a35t du cent pesant;\nles autres frais sont comme sur toute autre choses, pour le frait, portages, visitation, droits du\npoix, courtages et scullage, que vous pouvez a peu pres calculer sur les comptes de fil de\nlatton, dont je voy que desirez encore m\u2019envoyer 300 torches, scavoir 200 torches de la\nmesme sorte de celuy que m\u2019avez envoye et 100 torches de la mesme marque mais beaucoup\nplus gros. Cette derniere sorte ne sera pas bien propre icy, ainsy sy\u2019l n\u2019est charg\u00e9 advant la\nreception de la presente j\u2019estime que ferez bien de n\u2019en point envoyer plus de 50 torches pour\nun essay, mais ne pouvez manquer d\u2019en envoyer de l\u2019autre sorte ou en treuvera bien le debit.\nLa marque de la tulippe n\u2019est pas estimee icy. Ce sera pour garder longtemps ee\n\nCelle de la marque 'www/AW' se vendroit mieux; on l\u2019estime 40s pour cent moins que 'N', mais les\n\ntrois couronnes de Laurens de Gier sont icy en estime pardessus toutes les autres marques,\nselon quoy pouvez vous regler.

    "TEXT": "Your letter of the 30th past has reached me and this serves as a reply.\n\nMy brother, H[ermann] Olmius, tells me that two small ships have already been chartered\nat Wells(1) to bring grain to me here on your joint account. May the Lord bring them safely. I\nhope they are still over there at the moment as the weather has been very terrible on our\ncoasts with these daily north-west winds.\n\nGrains are just as quiet as they were before, especially barley, of which the best that comes\nfrom England is selling at \u00a323 flem. Rye is at 136, 140 and 145 [gold guilders], wheat at 155\nto 160 and 170 [gold guilders], malt at \u00a318\u2014\u00a321 flem., but if exports from England come to\nan end in February, as people tell me, grains will undoubtedly rise for Brabant promises to\ndouble its demand, and so it would not be unwise to store up what is coming from you.\n\nI am extremely grateful for the kindness you have demonstrated in wanting to continue\nour correspondence through a profitable business. On my side I shall keep you informed\nwhenever I spot anything profitable. Barbados sugar is very scarce and since the bad news\nfrom Barbados no one who has any will sell it, and the manufactured sugars have been sold\nbefore they are ready so it must rise considerably, in my judgement. The last were sold at 52g\nbut now there is no price quoted.\n\nThe exchange on France has risen to 1034, with all the signs of rising higher, and it has been\npointed out to me that with the exchange from [London] on Paris at 543d, to give that price\nthere and send the bills to be negotiated here and send you returns at 365 8-0\u00a2 (as it is today) is\na way of earning a rather nice interest.\n\nIf there is anything in which I can serve you or your friends, freely command, yours &c.",

I wish we had the opportunity to make it rather larger but things are in such\na bad way here that nowhere is there anything to be done. Thank you for informing me of\nthe prices of goods. I have carefully considered each one but could not find anything likely to\nbe profitable. Indeed, several commodities which you mention and which must necessarily\ncome from [England] have been sold here at a loss. May the Lord soon give us better times\nand a general peace and then trade, which is disrupted in nearly all parts of Europe, should\nrevive again. People are expecting that the ambassadors ofall the countries involved will soon\nbe meeting for peace negotiations at Nimwegen. May God grant that this long-wished-for\nwork may proceed so that in the coming year (in which I wish you all success and prosperity,\nas above) we may be cheered by news of peace.\n\nThe two kind letters of your wife, of the 24th of September and 1st of October, reached\nme in due course.

Please pay it on presentation and place it to my account,\nforgiving the pettiness of it.\n\nNow, concerning trade\u2014as you say, thanks to the conjuncture of war England has\nbecome the general warehouse and has nothing to complain about. Here, on the contrary,\nlittle or nothing is happening, nearly all commodities being at very poor prices and little or\nno demand for them. Regarding prices, I refer you to the enclosed price-current.1 Corn has\nbeen very high in price here and for some time large amounts have been coming from\nEngland. Something might well be done with that. I understand it has fallen in price at the\nmoment but, even so, it fetches good prices, vizt.:\n\nIt is rumoured here that the King may abolish the customs or duty which is given on its\nexport from England, or perhaps prohibit its export altogether. If that were done it would\ncause a striking increase in price here. But otherwise I can see little signs of any change in the\nimmediate future, and large amounts would have to come from England before it caused any\ndecline\u2014for your information.\n\nSo, if I can be of any service to you, you have only to command me, and with cordial\nregards I commend you and Madame, your wife, to the protection of God, and remain, &c.",

    "TEXT": "I last wrote to you on the 10th inst. I have since received, last Saturday, your three letters of\nthe 26th and 30th of November and 3rd of this month. By these I have seen your commission\nto buy 600 coils of Swedish 5-band brass-wire for 62 ML at the most, of which I have made a\nnote. But I am sorry to say that there is nothing to be done, as you will have seen quickly\nenough! from my previous letter, for the price of wire is rising daily here and now no\nSwedish wire can be had for less than 66 ML. This type is nearly all in the hands of one man\nwho is maintaining the price as he pleases, and the stock which he has is believed to be not\nmuch more than 1.000 coils. None can come from Sweden for the next year, and elsewhere\nnot much will be worked for lack of money and credit. One should be able to obtain\nHamburg wire at 66 ML, but I fear it will rise higher.\n\nFrom Rouen has just arrived, fully-loaded, Thomas Frost sailing Hendrick Weever\u2019s ship\ncalled De Perell, in which I do not dare to load anything although I suppose it is as safe as if it\nwere built in England. He last came here with it from [London] and is now, as I understand,\nchartered by a friend but before that will take in some wire for Rouen\u2014I mean, for\n[London]. There have been some English ships in lading here which, for a fortnight, have not\ndared to take in anything except from Englishmen. But others have taken in goods for\nanyone, and they are not especially obliged to go to other places, so on that point there is no\ndifficulty\u2014for your information. The Holstein ships are also passing freely. One from\nTonningen was brought in to Fryck[?] but by orders of the King was freed and his costs\nrepaid. People also have great hopes that our ships will again be allowed to sail freely. Philip\nMuncker, in whom your wire is loaded, is completely ready and only waits for a good wind.\nHis ship is a galliot and has no other name. May God help him arrive in safety.\n\nEnclosed herewith is going the account of the 150 coils of wire loaded aboard him,\namounting to \u00a3382 9s 2d, for which I debit you. Please check it, and if you find you agree\nwith it make a record of it. To all appearances you should do well with it. Besides Muncker\nthere are two other small ships laden for Rouen, which are also lying in the Elbe because of\ncontrary winds. Altogether I think these three ships are carrying away about 4.000 coils and\nnothing of other copper wares such as sheet-copper or brass, etc, as far as I can learn. To know\nthe exact details one must spend something on the customs lads, which I shall do and then\ninform you in my next. If you continue to want reports about this please let me know so that\nit can be arranged.\n\nThe friend who has about 1.000 coils has told me that he had decided to send them to\nBordeaux, and then another 200 coils of the \u2018Lily\u2019 brand, which can still be had for 65 ML,\nand to receive them without regard to the quality. For as soon as our manufacturers discover\nthat so little Swedish wire remains they will push up the price of their other brands. These\ntypes [of wire] have been usually paid for immediately, and it could well be impossible\u2014\nespecially in these times of rising prices\u2014to stipulate payment by waiting for remittances\nfrom London. And even if prices were not rising one would have to pay more if one sought\nto defer it. So, if you want this commission to be performed, please enlarge your price-limit\nand also give me permission to load in Thomas Frost, who will be ready in a few days. At the\npresent there is no other alternative. If I had performed the commission already I would have\ndrawn on you for my outlay, as your ordered, and consigned it to you as instructed.\n\nThe weather here is still mild, without any cold but plenty of rain and storm.\n\nThe bill of lading for the 103 sacks of ginger has been received and will be useful. I hope the\npurchase of 10 sacks of cotton at 53d has also gone ahead because, since they have been bought\noutright, the buyer ought to keep them. And I would judge that the hurricane in Barbados\ncan make little difference because, apart from this lot, nothing much from there has arrived\nfor a long time. If one can still get such good quality for 54d I would be content to go shares\nwith you in 30 sacks for which I think the price is so low that one can hardly go wrong with\nthem. If you are favourably disposed towards the idea please obtain such a quantity and send\nit here, on the understanding that not more than ro sacks are bought for me. If you think it\nadvisable you can delay this purchase until the ships expected from Smyrna arrive. It sells here\nfor 13g and 133g in lots of 1 or 2 bales. Our ships from Spain have not yet arrived but are expected every hour. With regards, &c.\n\n[P.S.] Thank you for the news about the hurricane. Asa result, Barbados sugar and ginger are\nselling rather better and if it continues it will cause further changes.",

It is true that there are three or\nfour Englishmen here such as the two Townleys and others that buy it and send it to England\nand I am sure that Banques has a share in it, but the idea that any monopoly should arise from\nthat is odious and accursed of God.

And since the season is now well advanced I shall have to wait until the spring\nbefore I shall be able to ship anything. Meanwhile, I see that the prices of brass as well as of\niron are very bad in [England]. However, there is very little brass being sent from here so\nwhatever is being sent to [England] must be from old stocks that have been lying at Hamburg\nand worked up there. It looks as if very little brass-ware will be made here this winter, partly\nbecause of the poor prices abroad and partly because they will be short of calamine.\nConsequently, these wares ought to be able to fetch a better price in the coming year if not\ntoo much is worked up at Aachen and Hamburg.\n\nHowever, the price of iron in [London] seems unlikely to improve for the present as the\ngreatest proportion of our exports has to be shipped to England, and the ships which have\nbeen held up nearly all year are about to arrive with substantial amounts of iron\u2014bringing\nmore than can be consumed in a whole year. For some weeks the price here has been standing\nat about 24 to 25 copper dollars, excluding expenses, but seems likely to fall lower. Garcopper\nis at 217 to 218 dollars per shippound, and \u2018Crown\u2019 copper-wire will cost about 573 to 58 RD\nper shippound on board a free ship with all expenses paid (each RD being worth 5 copper\ndollars). Pitch isat RD 40 and tar at RD 20 to 21 per last, free on board, though it cannot be\nshipped from here except through the Tar Company, and someone called John Strother\" has\ncontracted with them for everything which goes to England. St Ubes salt is at 164 to 17\ndollars per ton.\n\nThe war is making business very bad here and people see very little prospect of peace,\nwhich we pray God may grant. But I understand that there are negotiations for the freeing of\ntrade between this kingdom and Holland and if they succeed it must soon be made public.\n\nIf there should be any changes in the price of brass-ware I beg you to let me know, and also\ntell me how much the pieces of eight called \u2018pillar\u2019? are bought for in London and whether\nthey are allowed to be exported.\n If there is anything here I can serve you in, please ask freely.

Above all, we are faring so badly with the Reenstiernas and\nMomma that we have no more desire to make any contracts with them, so there is not the\nslightest chance of one being made.

    "TEXT": "My last was on the 4th inst., and since then I have received yours of the 28th of January.\nAbout the \u2018O\u2019 and \u2018G\u2019 iron, your reasoning is very good and I can well understand your\nargument, but since the prices of iron are at present so low it would turn out to be rather too\nexpensive, and as your iron is now selling for less than it costs in Stockholm it is my opinion\nthat very much less will be shipped this ycar, particularly as the commercial treaty between\nSweden and this state is likely to come into effect. We shall learn the outcome in a few days.\nThe estates of Holland are assembling within six days and if it goes ahead there are plenty of\nsalt ships here ready to depart, and as a result there will be no need to have anything to do\nwith English ships. As the salt ships can go nowhere but here with their return cargoes freight\nrates will fall and as prices are much better here the iron will also be shipped hither. However,\nyou must meanwhile continue to organize your sales as you have so far and as you find most\nconvenient, only give some thought to what I have said above.\n\nAs soon as we have the outcome of the treaty of commerce I shall let you know in case\nthere is anything worth thinking about with regard to salt. About 30 ships from St Ubes are\nexpected here any day and there are about 60 lying here in lading, several of which, if trade is\nfreed, will set off for Stockholm in June for f-64 to .63 per last, so there is no need to have\nanything to do with English ships. However, if one could charter one for \u00a36 or \u00a36 5s then\none might risk sending it to St Ubes and then on to Stockholm. If you can acquire such a one!\nwould be content for you to charter it for us provided that it sets sail at the earliest\nopportunity and so can arrive in time to join this fleet. Meanwhile, please find out if there is\nanything of value over there which could be freighted for Portugal and Stockholm. There is\nsomeone [in London] who has obtained six or seven ship-loads of salt for delivery in\nStockholm at a fixed price and who has given orders to charter ships here\u2014indeed, if he can\nobtain the right price he will buy salt here and send it on to Stockholm. I am expecting six or\nseven ships in the first fleet to arrive, but whether they will be going on to the Baltic I cannot\nsay yet. If you were inclined to take a one-fourth or one-third share in one or two, assuming\nthat I can arrange for them to go there, I would give you preference before others. I seldom\ntake others as partners but between us it could be arranged.\n\nI am also considering chartering one or two for St Ubes\u2014Stockholm\u2014Amsterdam, and if\nyou want to participate please let me know. I would guess that the ships which are now being\nchartered will be leaving about the 5th or 10th of April, and they could be in the Baltic by\nSeptember or October, provided that there is a convoy at St Ubes. I estimate freight at about\n\nf.64 to f.65 per English last, and f.3 or f.4 more if they are not to wait for the convoy, but one\nmust be careful to state in one\u2019s orders for the Sound whether the voyage is to Stockholm,\nReval or Riga. Reval lasts cost f.2 or f.3 more; Stockholm and Riga lasts are the same as here.\n\nAs for the insurance, find out how it should be arranged over there and let me know\u2014\nwith my thanks for informing me.\n\nI shall write about the pan-iron and see that they reckon up the numbers better.\n\nI am delighted that the suit with Mr Townley has now been settled.\n\nI have heard nothing more from the Baltic, and from Italy the news is rather conflicting,\nthough all speak of a hard and skilful fight by the French, and no ships taken, though some speak of one and others of two left behind. People are also talking of a second battle, or the\nbeginning of one, but there is as much guess-work as certainty about the business, so we must\nwait for another post\u2014wherewith I remain, &c.",

    "TEXT": "I have safely received your letter of the 13th past and from the accompanying power of\nattorney I have been delighted to learn from you for the first time that you have entered the\nbonds of matrimony with Madame Marescoe. I had only heard about it last week from Mr\nUrban Hall who came to visit me here, because your letters\u2014which would have informed\nme\u2014have not yet come to hand, and consequently I have not been able to discharge my\nobligation to wish you happiness together. This will therefore serve principally to wish you\nall good fortune, praying the Lord God to bless you and grant you many years of joy and\nprosperity together.\n\nI have noted with pleasure the safe arrival of Captain Goldstone and I have no doubt that\nthe Company(1) has taken the iron at the same price as before, as was intended, according to\nyour previous letter, for it is not my fault that the iron has arrived rather late. I expect to hear\nby the first post whether you have agreed with the Company to deliver my voyage iron this\nsummer for the price of \u00a314 5s, as you wrote in your last so that I can organize myself\naccordingly. For unless that is done I doubt whether I can arrange things so advantageously\nsince little iron has been forged here this winter and large amounts have been bought up for\npretty high prices.\n\nWith regard to the proceeds of your salt, I have written to you at length that it would be to\nyour best advantage if I settled it against your current account, because the iron was dearly\nbought and it was not advisable to store the salt since it could not be sold for so high a price in\nthe spring. I am now being offered a ship-load of salt by English merchants for 15 dollars per\nton and I see that you are thinking of consigning me another quantity of salt in the new year.\nIf you do so I shall dispose of it to your best advantage.\n\nRegarding the bill of exchange on Johan Fahlgreen: it is not yet paid. I have sent your letter\nto him, and I do not doubt that payment will soon follow as I have had news from Westras,(2)\nwhere the money is to delivered, that it is daily expected there, so I hope your letter of\nattorney will be unnecessary. Johan Trotzig has not yet paid up and I can get no answer from\nhim, though I have been told by his brother-in-law in Stockholm that he would pay shortly.\nIn future you would do well not to extend such credit, as you can be sure of a heap of trouble\nanda long wait. I have sent the RD 100 bill of exchange on Johan Staelhaus to Stockholm for\nacceptance and will give you news of it by my next. I see that Captain Guttery has arrived at\nGothenburg and I have written there to know how things stand with the goods. It is dreadful\nthat the posts are so unreliable and that we are mutually lacking so many letters. I cannot tell\nwhat remittances you have made for me to Mr Van de Mortel and, since the 20th of August, I\nhave received no letters from him. However, I hope you have withheld the proceeds of the\niron in the last two ships in order to offset the proceeds of your salt and the sum of the bills of\nexchange which, I think, altogether should just about balance each other.\n\nI have advised you before this that Mr Perman has given orders to Mr David Leyel [in\nLondon] to pay you the \u00a3150 relating to Jacob Fahlgreen;(3) and with regard to your claims\non Willem Momma I have not until now (with the power of attorney) received the necessary\ninformation, but as the goods have been sold to Mr Perman (as I wrote to you before) there is\nnothing which can be done now. Also, Momma says that he is no longer in debt to you, as\nyou perfectly well know. You would do well to obtain your claims on him amicably, like a\nsensible chap.(4)\n\nBecause the money in your account has now been offset there is nothing to be said about\nthe purchase of brass, but if you send a consignment of salt in the spring please write fully to order what you want done with the proceeds. I commend you to the protection of God,\ntogether with Madame, your dearly beloved;\n\n&c.\n\n[P.S.] Regarding the exportation of iron, I shall inform you further.",

But it seems to have been overlooked that that is\nall right as long as they are chartered by Englishmen; but if they are chartered by others who\nare also friends of Denmark, how are they going to manage? If they lade in English ships they\nare going to need other certificates, and in my opinion that is not very advantageous for the\nEnglish ships and not many are going to be chartered by foreigners. However, as some people\nwere of a different opinion a few have recently passed the Sound which were loaded here, so\neverything is continuing on the old basis.(1)\n\nI have written to Sweden to inform them along the lines which you advised and all the iron\nwhich has been kept back will be shipped for your account. I shall sell it solely to you and you\ncan be the guarantor or insurer against all risks and take it over on its arrival in return for a\ngain of 14 per cent.\n\nWinter is now ending over there and they will soon have open waters. There are also\nabout 300 slb of pan iron lying at Stockholm which I would send to you with the first\navailable English ships if any were lying there and if the freight charges were reasonably\ncheap. But at the moment there are still about 600 slb of ordinary iron over and above that,\nwhich I must consider first. Furthermore, I have given orders for improvements in the future\nmanufacture of pan iron so that the bars are more even, for they seem not to have been\nturning out smooth. I have no doubt that those which are coming will be entirely\nsatisfactory.\n\nAs I have to pay rather a lot of Swedish bills of exchange during the month of May I now\nhave to ask you if can draw on you \u00a3500 at two or three usances. I would be greatly obliged\nif you could accommodate me. And please let me know at once how much premium is at\npresent being demanded [for insurance] from Stockholm to London and to Amsterdam in\nEnglish shipping.\n\nAt present there is little news.

At last he offered 6 1/4s, at which price I sold them to\nhim. I could scarcely bring myself to agree, seeing that the price is miserable and does not\nleave much above 9 per cent profit, but your urging to sell at the earliest opportunity and the\nfact that others are selling moved me to do so. And in my opinion I did well, for various\npeople have it for sale and much more is expected. We would have done better if ours had\narrived earlier, for a friend of mine has had 22 casks which he received with an earlier captain\nand he sold them at 6 5/8s. There is also news from England that another ship from the\nBermudas is expected this year which will bring a good quantity and I believe this must be\nthe reason why good quality stuffis already being offered today at 6s which puts that which\nwas bought for 6 1/2[d] in London in a bad position. I wish you had not also bought this last lot,\nthough if it is thoroughly good we must see if it cannot be sold perhaps for a rather higher\nprice. Among those which I sold were various rolls which were so rotten and completely dry\nthat they could be crumbled into powder, and the purchaser consequently claimed a 30 |b.\ndeduction. How far we should agree with him let me know in your next. As soon as the\ncaptain completes his loading the account will be sent with him.\n\nIf the campeachy wood which I asked for has not yet been bought please forget it for I fear\nthat much has arrived with the galleons in Spain and it may perhaps fall lower in price.

If you decide to do so, please buy 6.000 to 8.000 lb. for our account\nat a price of about 4 1/2d, making quite sure that it is good quality and undamaged. You must\nalso see that it is bought advantageously at the best time, for unless one makes an\nadvantageous purchase there is no chance of making a profit these days.

I expect the loss to be settled, for the longer one\ndelays the worse it is, and I am surprised that the insurers of the Caritas lay claim to the full\ninsurance. It is quite true that they ran the risks while the ship was lying in the Daalders and\nwere liable, and also for the risks of going to London when, because of the war, the goods\nmight have been lost. I am not liable to pay for the insurance to London, and I ask for nothing\nmore than what is just and fair. You can judge it impartially yourself.\n\nYou say, regarding the said goods, that you have sent a power of attorney because\nsomeone has assured you that Hiebenaer is making some claim on them. Whoever wrote that\nto you has deceived you with lies and it is quite unnecessary for you to meddle with it and\nsend powers of attorney, for I myself shall answer for it here.\n\nRegarding the latten, black kettles and basins, please make an end of them and do not\nhaggle about the price. I was influenced by the advice I got from [England] on April 11th,\n1671, when someone else stated that 400 shippounds of black or yellow kettles could be\ndisposed of every year, and perhaps even more, but I see now that one cannot rely on such\nadvice.\n\nI am also not a little surprised that you remind me to take care that I reimburse you for your outlay, yet I have not received any account and do not know what your claims are. I\nshall therefore await an account first, and with regards, remain, &c.",

Iron\nprices should stay steady this year as there will be much less made than last year because many\nforges have been unable to work for lack of water.

But as for your proposition that all the copper-wire which may be made up to\nNovember next year should be placed in one person\u2019s hands and not be allowed to cost more\nthan \u00a35\u2014\u00a35 5s in London, there is not the slightest prospect of it for the simple reason that\nthe creditors of the \u2018Three Crowns\u2019 and \u2018Crowned N\u2019 works have to contribute payments to\nhelp the works get going, and as a result the owners are not free to dispose of the brass which\nis produced at their works. Secondly, all the brass which has been made here for the last year\nhas cost not less than 245 to 250 dollars per shippound, because the high price of copper has\nbeen supported by the launching of the copper coinage, and it could not cost less than \u00a35 145\nin London, with all expenses included, even if it could be bought here for 250 dollars. Indeed,\nthat price has been offered in vain and it looks as if it will rise higher still as soon as the ships\ncome to be loaded because little has been produced \u2014the \u2018Three Crowns\u2019 works having been\nat a standstill for a whole year, and the \u2018Crowned N\u2019 works going slow and at a standstill for\nthe last two months. For the last fifteen months I have had about 470 slb from the \u2018Three\nCrowns\u2019 works lying at Norrk\u00f6ping which I was prevented from exporting by last year\u2019s\ntroubles. It consists of about 313 slb of copper-wire, so slb of latten, 50 slb of black kettles,\n30 slb of \u2018English\u2019 kettles, 10 slb of \u2018Scottish\u2019 pans and 5 slb of pots. Mine was part of a\nconsignment which should have gone to London but which cannot be sent now as I\nunderstand there is a restrictive order in force requiring one to declare that the goods loaded\nin English ships are for English accounts. It is good of you to offer to take on all the risks and\nto reclaim the goods as if they were your own, being consigned in your name, in return fora\nreasonable consideration, but you have not stated how much and these wares can only bear a\nlittle. If it could be done for 1 per cent above the ordinary insurance rate I might well agree to\nit; at 2 per cent there are plenty here who could do it but I would find that too much. If you\nwould charge only 1 1/2 per cent on top of the sales-commission and order my brothers at\nAmsterdam to arrange the insurance and manage the expenses so as to avoid the deduction\nwhich London insurers make in case of loss(1) I shall be interested to hear your opinion and\nawait your decision at the earliest opportunity. If by any chance some shipping-space should\nturn up and permit the despatch of some goods on these conditions the insurance should be\ncalculated on the basis of \u00a313 1/2 sterling per shippound and the sale made in as short a time as\npossible so that no bad debts can arise.\nNotwithstanding the fact that iron is fetching little abroad the price here is being\nmaintained at 24 and 25 dollars per shippound.\nI wish you and Madame Marescoe all happiness and prosperity in your marriage, with\n\nheartiest greetings, &c, I remain, &c.",

    "TEXT": "My latest letters to you were on the 16th of February by way of Stockholm, on the 1st of\nApril by way of Gothenburg and on the 4th instant through Stockholm. I have sent copies\nwith each one and refer you to them. I have since received your welcome letter of the 10th of\nApril, from which I more fully understand your discourse about the free passage of ships and\nwhat arrangements you have organized and, above all, that I should speak with our friends\nhere about bringing all the wire into your hands to prevent undercutting. And since your\ncompetitors have now all been bought out and all the wire is only in your hands the price has\nrisen to \u00a36 ssand could well be held at \u00a36 tos, and before the end of the year you will have\nno difficulty in getting \u00a37\u2014which makes it all the more surprising to me that you have not\nbeen able to sell my wire for more than \u00a36 and have left if lying for eight months and have\nbeen selling it quite disgracefully although you knew that this change could be achieved and\nin spite of my warnings that it could well have been kept another two or three months!\n\nLalso find that I have no relevant answer to my letters, for in those of September 1675\n(which you have received) I wrote about the account of the wire sold by you at Rouen and\nmaking good the loss, but to that I have had no answer and there still remains due to me the\naccount of more than 2.000 coils which were sold in 1674. I shall expect both accounts so that\nI can see how to organize myself. You crave only that all these goods should come into your\nhands but do not consider the risks which the owners would have to run, for even if one had\nthem fully insured it would still be unsafe because one cannot be certain nowadays that bills\nof exchange! would arrive on time. If you want to get all the wire into your hands you must\ndo it differently and send a servant here who can acquire it and also pay out the money and\ndeclare them to be English goods. Otherwise all this writing is in vain, as I have said to you\nbefore.\n\nThere are now a good many ships from England arriving at Stockholm, but I doubt that\nthey will make any great profit, selling salt at 11 to 12 dollars per ton, and even if they gain\nhandsomely on the incoming cargoes I suspect they will have to sit still and wait for the\noutgoing ones, for they cannot load their ships with anything but tar, pitch and iron, of\nwhich there is plenty and which will be so abundant in England that it will be unsaleable. But\nnot as much wire will be coming as is wanted because little is being manufactured here, and\nwithout some unforeseen events there is likely to be a lack of calamine and clay which this\ncountry does not produce and without which the works cannot go on. It was only a little\nwhile ago that you said that the clay, which I asked for and you sent, was of small importance\u2014but to me itis extremely important, and having nothing more to say I remain,\n&c.",

Your letters came to my hands but the 11th present by which I understood\nof your sending me 3.000 pieces of eight and your order to receive the fifth part of the fraight\nthe Providence hath made from England, and to send you returnes by the same ship if possible.\nAs yet none of the money come up but expect it in 3 or four daies. They will sell for the best\ncambio any pieces of eight hath sold for these ma[n]y years. I not knowing of your sending of\nany before the ships arrived hath hindered me from providing returnes, which now is\nimpossible being no goods in towne, nor hath their bin any gaules this yeare bought for\nreason being exceeding scarce, though have made a shift to gitt 300 sacks against the\nProvidence arrived that shee might not loose any time. They are for account of Sir John\nLethieullier, Mr Burkin and Mr Torriano and were sent for Scanderoon before the ship\narrived. The Company haveing made an Order that all unfreemen that traid a broake of\n20 per cent (on what goods soever are sent from hence) should be paid, soe that I presumed it\nmight have altered your intention of sending downe any money. It remaincing behind will\nbe no prejudeice to you, for we expect no ships here tell our Generall Ships arrive, and in\n3 months will be new gaules and silke, which are alwaies procured at first very cheipe, and I\nhope by that time to understand your being free of our Turky Company. It lies not in my\npower to culler your goods in my name, the whole factory being sworne to give in a true\nentry to our consul of what goods we send, though not for money we receive.\n\nYour ship Providence may be ready to depart in 20 daies, your 100 sacks of gaules being not\nladen will be no prejudeice to her for shee will make an extraordinary fraight to Legorne,\nthrice as much as the voyadge before.

As I act in your concernes shall advise you. I would send you a sortment for\ncloth but its to late for next ships nor should we give you any great incurradgement to send\nany but ready money, pieces of eight or lyon dollars from Holland with which can procure what goods you desire and send quick returnes, which is all at present, we remaine Sir, your\nmost faithfull and obliged servant, T.L.\u2019",

God be praised, I am not\namong those involved.\n\nWith friendly regards, &c.\n\n[P.S.] On closing this I received your letter of the 28th of July, to which there is little to be\nsaid. I see that the [East India] Company has decided to sell its goods on the 5th of September\nwhen one thing or another ought to be quite cheap, but for myself I cannot decide to\nencumber myself with further goods, for however cheaply one buys there is always\nsomething cheaper around. It is best to sit quietly for a while, hoping that these bad times will\nat last change and get better. I thank you for the news about various commodities\u2014I have\nbeen glad to see their prices and they will be useful for me to think about, wherewith I\n\nremain, &c.",

    "TEXT": "On the 4th of June I wrote letters to you by way of Stockholm and on the same date by way\nof Gothenburg, which I hope have come to your hands and to which I refer. I have since\nreceived, by way of Gothenburg, your welcome letter of June 16th in which there is much\nthat requires an answer.\n\nI have grasped what you relate at length about the sale of the 1.720 coils of wire which you\nincluded as sold in three accounts of 1675 (in September, October and November) and on the\n5th and 13th of January 1676, but I have plenty of reason to complain about it for since the\n15th of January 1675 you have scarcely written to me about what has been sold except to say,\nin the account dated 13 January 1676, that since 15 January 1675 (when I last had news) my\ncopper-wire has remained lying unsold while others have been selling at \u00a36 and \u00a36 2s for 2\nmonths time, at \u00a36 4s and \u00a36 3s for 4 months time, and \u00a36 5s at 6 months time. And\naccording to your recent letter of June it has continued selling since then at \u00a36 4s and 5s and\n\u00a36 3s and \u00a36. I can hardly accept your excuse that there were such large amounts of wire\nfrom others and that theirs was preferred before mine, for in several letters you have said that\nmost of it has been bought up, that very little was out of your hands and that you soon\nexpected to have your \u2018turn\u2019 and intended to sell at higher prices. Take a look at your letters\nfrom the beginning of 1675 up to June\u2014I have had little news since then that it has been my\n\u2018turn\u2019! It is as if you had no wire of mine in your hands. And now I have unexpectedly got the\naccount of the 1.720 coils sold as above, so you must not find it strange that I complain\nexcessively. I shall not clear your account of the debt but make a note that you have\nadministered such an amount. And as for the wire which was sold in 1674, you say the\naccount was sent at the proper time but I cannot find it in any of your letters, much less find\nany mention of it. Now I have got the copy of three accounts, but in none of the three is the\ntime stated from which you have credited my account. In the one concerning 900 coils I have\nnothing to say except that you have made an error of 7s 3d in the parcel sold to Elizabeth\nPacker on the 27th of November\u2014in place of the \u00a3158 1s 11d which you put it ought to be\n\u00a3158 9s 2d. In the other account, of 700 coils, I find the weight is rather less than it ought to\nbe and the time for some parcels should be altered from 1 month to 6 or 7 weeks.\n\nBut the third account, of 870 coils, I cannot find acceptable at all, since you state them to\nhave been sold without putting any date or time, and also without naming any person but\nsimply \u2018to sundry\u2019\u2014which is not a style that ought to be used. And, above all, these 870 coils\nare over 10 centner short of their weight\u2014which you will please have checked and then give\nme some pertinent explanation.\n\nI have now also received the account of the 360 coils of wire sold in Rouen, and in that it is\nstated that you have to make good \u00a37.728t 7s 11d for the proceeds and that you have made\ngood to me alone \u00a37.575\u00a2 tos 6d. How that comes about you will know best, and about the\ncompensation for the damage on the ship Samson (where there is also 7 centner short on the\nweight of the kettles) there is nothing mentioned\u2014which is all taking too long.\n\nlintend to do nothing about Townley\u2019s claim, for it is an unjustifiable claim, as all upright\nand impartial persons can judge. It is the same with the insurance on the Caritas, on which the\ninsurers will hand over no more than the premium, while the insurers in Holland in a similar\ncase raised no questions.\n\nThe reason why you have had the RD 2.000 bill of exchange returned is\u2014you say\u2014\nbecause you have little or nothing for me on account, alleging further that there is a bad debt\nowing by someone called Harrison for goods sold in the time of your partnership with Mr\n\nJoye. But I find that that item was made good to me over four years ago in my current\naccount and as no mention of it was ever made it does not convince me. It is no wonder that\nyou have nothing for me if you handle things in such a manner!\n\nI quite understand that it is not permitted to export earth(1) on pain of death\u2014one cannot\nafford to run such a risk. It is abundant in our area around Aachen and also in the Li\u00e9ge\ncountry and in France but the war prevents us from being able to get any here.\nPeople have been saying for a long while that the trade treaty with Holland would be\nconcluded, ratified and exchanged, but since then it has remained quiet. Meanwhile the\nEnglish alone have the trade of Stockholm, though I believe it will be of little profit for they\ndispose of their goods at Stockholm reasonably cheaply and on their return cargoes (and\nespecially iron) they will lose a great deal. They behave in the way you described\u2014as soon as\nthey have acquired their cargoes they are forced to sell in order to pay for the freight and\nexpenses, but it is not for someone like me to object\u2014one must know how to make a profit\nuntil this squall is over, for like the last I do not think it will endure for long and as soon as the\nshipping returns I believe things will go for me as they did before. I can send nothing as long\nas these wars last, nor would I advise you to send anything to my son unless you also send a servant who could declare them to be English goods.

    "TEXT": "I arrived back here about two days ago, and before my departure from Middelburg yours of\nthe 1st instant came safely to my hands together with an account of the iron received from\nWillem Mynart,(1) with which I have recorded my agreement.\n\nI was not happy to see that a quantity of \u2018OO\u2019 iron has come to London despite the fact\nthat I was afraid it might arrive by mistake. My nephew, Trip, bought a quantity at\nStockholm for delivery here, as was agreed, but later it slipped his memory so that when he\nheard that iron was much dearer in Stockholm than here he gave orders for it to be sold,\nforgetting to write that it was not to go London, and that is how the mistake occurred. I\nwould have gladly remedied it, but it was too late. You can judge if the people will make\nanything with it, having paid 26 1/2 to 27 dollars per shippound in Stockholm.\n\nBefore my departure from Middelburg I wrote to tell you to insure the iron in the\nZebulon, captain Joseph Pyll,(2) for \u00a31.000 sterling which I trust has been completed. The said\ncaptain had rather severe weather in the Baltic and lost his mast and came to the roadstead off\nDanzig to refit, according to my nephew Trip there who left from Stockholm in his\ncompany. I hope he has now got fine weather so that we can soon expect him. Boor writes to\nme that he sent the letter containing the bill of lading by way of Gothenburg so it may soon\narrive here or reach you. There was also some pan-iron expected which would also be sent to\nyou with the first available ship. No other iron will be sent to you for the present, so what\nyou have should hold its price. Iron is scarce in Sweden and all that has appeared is now being\nshipped here.\n\nWe are trying to do something about getting the posts going and have sent orders to the\nResident Lemere(3) to speak with the King of Denmark about it, but he could not comprehend\nwhy it was not taken too well here, knowing that one can drive no trade without letters. We\nhave decided that if Denmark does not show any understanding we shall pay them no\nsubsidies until the posts are going freely again, and I believe the Danes will soon change their\nminds.\n\nI have today received letters from Stockholm dated 14/24 August which mention that\nCaptain Pyll lay ready to depart, so if nephew Trip had not written that he had come to\nDanzig I would assume that it must be another ship\u2014unless there are more captains with the\nsame name.\n\nHerewith goes the bill of lading, which is the fifth. The others have to date not yet arrived.\nSome more iron will be loaded with the first available ship.\n\nI suppose it will not inconvenience you if I drew against this cargo while the present rate of\nexchange is rather high, for cash is quite scarce now that the ships from Sweden are about to\narrive.\n\nBy the next I shall write to the Lord Douglas in case he comes to speak with you. Please tell\nhim that I have today drawn on you \u00a3651 17s 3d according to the details below,(4) which are\nrecommended to your care:\n\nConcerning the wine cargo which I mentioned before, I shall now only say briefly\u2014that the\nfreight must cost no more than 5s or 10s more (or less) than others; that one must look for a\ncaptain who is known to be an enterprising seaman, a man who can judge a situation well; the\nship must not be too big and its bills of lading must be correct for the Baltic. Let the insurers\ntake care of the cargo, worth 5.000-6,000 \u00a3t. I suppose the premium from here will be\n9 or 10 per cent, or rather less. Lacam at Bordeaux is good.\n\nThere is little good wine to be sent from here, but from France nonetheless the expenses are\njust as large. I shall enlarge on all this by my next. If you think it is a good idea give such\norders as you think fit. I cannot tell whether it will turn out well, without any mishap. If the\nship is rather bigger load it also with such new goods as are in demand from there, but make\nsure they are good things which are loaded. My time has run out so I must break off until the next post. Meanwhile, I remain, &c.",

    "TEXT": "I last wrote to you about three days ago. Since then I have received yours of the 8th instant,\nfrom which I have seen that Smyrna cotton is not to be had below 5 1/2d and that consequently\nthere was nothing that could be done about my commission. So one must be patient and let it\nrest for the moment, I have recorded my agreement with your account of the indigo and\nlikewise with that for two bales of Ardasse, so there is nothing to say arising from these. Your\ncask of Jamaican indigo has turned out well, which its purchasers cannot deny, but they will\nnot agree to give a higher price for it. However, I shall do my best with it and if there is\nanything to report I will let you know.\n\nWilliam Cutler has arrived here, God be praised! I shall now procure the receipt of the two\nbales of silk and try to sell them as soon as possible to our maximum advantage. I see you have\nno great inclination to sell it for time, but it may not be possible to avoid and if I decide to do\nso I shall stand surety for you, not doubting that you will allow me 1 per cent for it, for it is\ncustomary here for people to deduct 4 per cent for selling and standing surety for Italian silks.\nHowever, to encourage our relationship I shall answer to you for 24 per cent.\n\nThe campeachy wood went for ML 7 8s, which is a poor price. A friend of mine received\na quantity with Cutler\u2019s ship which cost him ros in [London], so I hope yours will not cost\nmore, otherwise I could not support you. Swedish garcopper can be bought for RD 58 and is\nselling in Rouen for 74\u00a3t which does not leave much margin in my opinion, so I may not\nperform your commission. The expenses here are about the same as on the wire, so you can\nbest work it out. Of Swedish wire there is none to be had and, as I said in my previous letter,\nthere is also none arriving at L\u00fcbeck. If it was here it could be fetching 68 ML and Hamburg\nwire fetches 70 ML per centner, so in that commission there is also nothing to be done. About\n250-300 coils of Hamburg wire have been shipped to Bordeaux. For Rouen I have not been\nable to learn quickly what has been shipped. The expenses on wire, here and at L\u00fcbeck, are\nabout 73 ML, not counting the freight from Sweden to L\u00fcbeck, per shippound of 320 lb.\nMost of it is brought by way of L\u00fcbeck\u2014it seldom comes directly, for your information. A\ngreat quantity of iron has arrived at L\u00fcbeck which may weaken the market rather, but of\ncopper and wire people think little will come out of Sweden this year because of the large\nduty and the unfreedom of their ships.\n\nIf my 4 barrels of blue-dye are still unsold, please look after them, for one hopes this\ncommodity will rise in price because henceforth only a limited quantity will be made. If you\nhave achieved anything for me with regard to the [East India] Company I expect to hear.\nPlease buy another 4 cases of indigo guatemalo at 2s 8d or below and, if it is possible, pour out\nsome so that you are not deceived, or otherwise check one barrel thoroughly to see if it is a\nhigh-quality blue. If it is fine, without anything false or mixed with powder, please take it\nand inform me ofit. Your draft of RD 50 in specie will be promptly paid and debited to you.\nConcerning the information about the position of Sirps, I am grateful to you. A friend here\nhas also had letters from him, but the letters in which he gave orders for his reimbursement\nfailed him. However, he does not doubt that he will give him complete satisfaction,\nwherewith cordial regards, &c.\n\n[P.S.] Regarding what I said above, at least 1.000 coils of wire are going to Rouen with a\nHolstein ship provided with a French pass, but according to letters received today from\nAmsterdam the same ship has been seized at Dunkirk. Enclosed herewith is a price-current(1)\nfor your inspection. About white scraped ginger, please wait for the arrival of the Barbados\n\nships.",

At\nNorrk\u00f6ping this year there has been absolutely no shipping-space available for any\ndestination and because of the dispute between the Crown and Queen Christina over the\ncustoms duty no goods have been able to come here from Norrk\u00f6ping. I have been waiting\nin vain for some opportunity to ship out something. There is now going there a small English\nship called the John & Edward, captain John Stabler, from Bridlington, which is chartered for\nthe account of Francis Townley and going from there to the river Thames where it will\nreceive orders from Townley whether it is to travel to Rouen or unload at London. But lam\nquite sure that it will sail off before you can load any goods in her. There is a quantity of brass\nloaded in the said ship, ordered by Mr John Greene, who wants it insured in [London], and on\nmy recommendation it is addressed to you. Please serve him to the best of your ability. You\nwill receive orders from him about the amount of the premium to recover from my brothers\nin Amsterdam.\n\nI understand that another English ship, with salt, is expected shortly at Norrk\u00f6ping. If it is\nreturning to London you can expect a quantity of brass with it. It is a troublesome business\nthat one can hardly succeed in loading anything, If it were not so late in the year I would\nmake up my mind about getting a small vessel to come from England, and I would have done\nso already if I had not been given hope that the dispute over the customs duty would have\nbeen settled by now.\n\nThe coarse cloths called \u2018dozens\u2019 have been selling at a good profit this year, likewise the\ncalicoes, such as bleached \u2018moorees\u2019, \u2018hummums\u2019 and \u2018addaties\u2019 and all kinds of French\nhaberdashery.(1)\n\nBecause of the quantity of copper coins which have been minted, silver and gold have risen\nso one might easily make 10 or 12 per cent on pieces of eight or silver ware.\nFine iron remains still at 25 to 27 copper dollars, copper at 220 dollars, brass-wire at\n260 dollars, and little to be had.

I must\nconfess that I did not know the conditions which prevail in England as well as I now\nunderstand them from you. Things are arranged quite differently here. It is true that in some\ncases money is given by those who are widows, who wish to continue living with their sons.\nFor they have little knowledge of places abroad and are unwilling to send their children\naway, and since they are people of means they are quite happy to give a sum of money so that\nthey can be accommodated and keep their children at home. Some are taken on for\nnothing \u2014or, at least, without money\u2014as we did with our servant Claes Bene who, as we\nknow, corresponds with you about the purchase of his goods. For six years he served us for\nnothing, and for the other two years that he was with us we gave him RD 100 per annum.\n\nMeanwhile, I see that you are very willing to take my son and prefer him before others\nwho have been offered to you if I will engage him for seven years, give surety for his honesty\nin the sum of \u00a32.000 sterling and pay \u00a3300 sterling for seven years. Regarding the first two\npoints I could well consent, namely that he should serve seven years and I could give security\nof \u00a32.000 for fidelity for of that lam entirely confident. But to pay \u00a3300 sterling in addition\nI think is rather too much, seeing that there is no trade and very little going on, so that our\nlives are very constricted. When some improvement is expected I would be very willing to\ngive \u00a3200 flem. or RD 500 in order to have my son in your firm, but since you say you have\noffered to do his pleasure for the former condition of \u00a3300 sterling but not for \u00a3200 flem. or\nRD 500 I must thank you for your kindness. In passing I have since discovered that, while\nyoung men in [England] do give money, there are other conditions which you did not\nmention\u2014that those who have served out their apprenticeship and carried themselves well\nand want to remain with the firm can enjoy a half-share of the commissions and several other\nconditions, which you know better than I do. It means that they can soon earn back the\nmoney they have paid for their service. What you decide about this I hope to learn in due course. With very friendly regards, I remain, &c.",

We thank you for all your trouble but, as we have often said, we\ncan see nothing profitable among the one or the other, for there is no demand and the\nexchange rate on [London] remains high. Prices are being much undercut here by the\nEnglish, as well as others, so if one wants to invest one\u2019s money one can do it here more\nadvantageously than in [England]. We still have the last 265 sacks of ginger which we\nbought, lying here unsold with other lots, and are negotiating to buy another 400 sacks here\nwhich we are being offered at 4g per lb. with 8 2/3 per cent discount. Among them are many\nsacks of white ginger and we are offering 3 3/4g on the above conditions. Whether we can\nobtain them for that a few days will reveal. As for what else trade has to offer, pepper is going\nvery cheaply in Holland. We are expecting a quantity for ourselves. Campeachy wood is\ncheap and we have been considering speculating in it for some time but cannotas yet make up\nour minds. It fetches only 7 3/4 ML per 100 lb and the old was 83. Grains are continuing to sell,\nsuch as rye at RD 57 to 58 and fine wheat at RD 61 to 62 per last. The wheat is likely to be\ncheaper than the rye in future. Insurance on English ships has jumped because with every post\none hears of them being intercepted and held, and the Germans will hesitate to be as liberal\nabout lading in them as they have been.

    "TEXT": "In answer to yours of the 13th instant, I am grateful that you will be of assistance to the Lord\nG[ ? ] on his arrival. In a similar case I would be likewise at your service.\n\nI further see that you have not been able to achieve anything in the purchase of tobacco,\nsince nothing good was obtainable below 6d. It is true that I see no prospect of it falling here\nfor the moment, but I do not think it would be advisable to spend more than sd per lb. for\nthere would be nothing we could do with it when the expected ships arrive in [London] and\ngood quality stuff is obtainable at sd. I refer you to my foregoing letter.\n\nYou report campeachy wood at 10s, at which price there is nothing to be done, I find.\nHowever, I am told that it is being sold for 9s in [London] so if you could buy it at that price,\nfree on board, and will take a half share, I would gladly take the other half of 25.000 lb. on\ntrust. It sells here for f.6 3/4 per 100 lb., but with such a quantity one might have to settle for f.6 1/2.\nEnglish copperas fetches f.6 1/4 to f.6 1/2 per 100 lb. and I would be glad to learn what it costs in\n[London], for there seems to be something to be done with that as well.\n\nThank you for news of ships arriving in [London] as well as of what is happening in trade.\nLittle is happening here. Bermuda tobacco comes here seldom and at present there is none in\ntown. If any should come it would not fetch above 4 or 5 stuivers per lb. Brazil tobacco in\nvarieties are from 9 to 10 stuivers per lb. to 124.and 13 stuivers for the best. Indigo guatemalo\nis at 28 to 30 stuivers per lb., Pernambuco wood at f.34 per 100 lb. Roman alum 47s per 100 lb\nand English 33s. Cochineal is mostly at 303s per lb. Aleppo galls are f.34 per 100 lb., Smyrna\nditto, f.27 1/2. Senegalese gum is at [blank], White Brazilian sugar, 10 to rxg per lb., and\nmuscovadoes 8 1/2 to 8 3/4g per lb.; Barbados sugar 6 1/2 to 6 3/4g per lb. and Nevis 6 3/4 to 7g per lb.\nLead is 24s [per 100 lb.], tin f.45 [per 100 lb.]. Brown ginger f.11 1/2 per 100 lb.; white ditto f.13.\nApulian oil \u00a357 lem. per tun; Seville ditto, \u00a356; Port Oporto and Lisbon \u00a353 to \u00a355.\nZante currants f.16 per 100 lb. Milanese rice 47s per 100 lb. Cardamon 444 stuivers per |b.;\ncubebs 8 1/2 stuivers. Ardasse silk, 16 to 16 1/2s per lb. Because of the great differences in Turkish\nyarn there is little I can say about them. Ordinary Angora is at 3 1/2 to 5s per lb.; better sorts at 6\nto 10s per lb., and the best from 12, 13 to 155 per lb. Begbesar from [hole], Camel hair is in\nreasonable demand here. Aleppo fetches from [hole] to 33 and 34 stuivers per lb.; Smyrna\nfrom 28 to 29 and 30 stuivers. Smyrna cottons are 10 to 12 1/2g per lb.; Cyprus cottons 12 to 13g\nper lb.; Barbados yellow [cotton] 15 to 16 1/2g and white ditto 14 to 15 1/2g per lb. The best\nnutmegs now sell for 55 stuivers per lb.; poorer quality fetch 50 stuivers; cloves are\n804 stuivers and mace 16 1/2 to 18s per lb.; cinnamon from [hole] to 60 and 70 stuivers. Madder,\n\nf.25 to 26; unprocessed ditto from f.18 to f.19. Cut whalebones are f-45, iron pots f.7 1/2 and\ncopper kettles f.624 per 100 lb. The best Danzig steel in small barrels now fetches only f.113\nper 100 lb. Since I sent you the notice of our [East India] Company prices other wares are\nselling as in the enclosed notice and in Zeeland they began their sale yesterday.\n\nThe English draperies trade is absolutely at rock-bottom here since there is no demand for\nthe goods and they are selling at very low prices. The smallest white pack-cloths of 28 yards\nlength have been sold for from \u00a311 to \u00a311 flem.(1) per piece, according to quality, and I\nnotice that white northern kerseys are now reasonably current, fetching from f.18 to f.22 per piece. Mixed grey kerseys are from f.20 to f-22 per piece, for your guidance. If you see any\nservice I can do for you, you have only to command, wherewith I remain, &c.",

I thanck the recommendation (of\nthe ship of corne intended hither) to mee. I have this yeare had 8 or ro thousand bushells of\nthat comodity which sold at losse, it coming after the fayre. Many shipps arriving therewith\nbefore and a promiseing harvest approaching lowered the pryse above 30 per cent although\nwhats good sells now somewhat better. This is no market for that corne but that for 2 years\npast was a scarcity in Castill made it here extreame deare, but licence beeing granted for its\ncoming freely from France brought a supply. However, if yours bee good it may sell for\nabout 8s sterling per hanegas, whereof 2 bushells inglish make one, and 6 per cent losse more.\nIn Ireland I am informed its verry cheape.

    "TEXT": "My last letter was on the [blank]. Since then I have received yours of the 10th instant.\n\nOur people in Sweden have no need to sell our iron without orders. What came last year\nwas due to a misunderstanding, as I explained to you.\n\nAs for the 1.500 slb, it is neither \u201cO\u2019 nor \u201cG\u2019 iron. My brother Emanuel, who also has\nworks in Sweden, always sells his iron in Stockholm. It may well be that your friend has\nbought some of that iron, but I believe he will have paid dearly enough for it. It is an iron\nwhich always come here as a rule. It is also an Orgronts iron, but he will first have to make\npeople familiar with it. The smiths always mark it \u2018L' and there is none in England.\nEverything that was made last year came wholly here, and next year\u2019s production has not yet\nbeen sold. He is accustumed to sell all his iron to one man in one place, and this year nephew\nTrip has had it. He makes about 6.000 to 7.000 slb per annum, so this 1.500 slb must be old\nstuff. If the purchaser is wise he will have that iron sent here. It would yield him more than the\n19s [per cwt.] in London for it is familiar here.\n\nAbout the time that the ships were coming out of the Sound they passed the Nachtegael\nwhich had been forced by contrary winds to run into Norway. Since Mr Lacam? cannot\nachieve anything about chartering a ship we shall have to let it lic. It would not have been a\nbad voyage, arriving before the winter, but in the spring it would not be advisable for there\nwill be quite enough provided from here.\n\nI trust the price of wine will change considerably for it is low here but rising, and is doing\nso in Sweden, so I believe the English will not be fetching so much in the coming year. Those\nwho were there with salt ships this year will lose their appetites for going again, and because\nDutch ships now have free passage there will be no English ships which can sail there at that\nprice. One can freight from here to St Ubes to Stockholm and back again for less than f-52 per\nlast of 18 tuns, if delivery is at Stockholm. I would judge that freight-rates at Stockholm will\nbe low next summer and one can already reasonably foresee that the price of salt will not be\nvery high.\n\nAbout this commodity, I have been speculating that because it is forbidden in Portugal to\ncome to St Ubes in ballast there are few ships here which want to go there, and if that remains\nthe case while winter comes on I might find that not many ships have been chartered to go\nthere, and then it might be worthwhile chartering one or two English ships, if they can be got\nfor less than \u00a36 sterling, in view of the fact that with few English ships coming to Stockholm\nfreight rates at London may be quite cheap. I shall thus be glad to learn from you at what\nprice one should be able to obtain them. If one could succeed in getting them for \u00a35 it would\nbe tolerable, even allowing for the fact that because of the high rate of exchange the money\nwould be worth more and amount to at least f.57. But the return freight would be paid for in\nheavy money and another advantage to set against it is that, with the English sailing without\nconvoy, they should be able to get to Stockholm rather carlier if the Dutch ships are not\ncalled for in time.\n\nI am not at all of the opinion that the English will want to go to St Ubes at that price, but\nthey might be willing to when the winter is nearly over, and to take away their fear of lying\nwaiting a long time we could stipulate two months for the total loading time at St Ubes and\nStockholm. If the ship going to St Ubes is clear to load up we must write to my\ncorrespondent, N. Simons, who can ensure that he is loaded within 14 days.\n\nThe freight-rate between here and St Ubes is less than f.28. I shall now wait to hear from\nyou at approximately what price it can be expected to be [in England] for my guidance in\ncase the St Ubes flect has departed from here.\n\nIf you have any inclination to have a Dutch ship fetch a load of salt and go to Stockholm,\nplease let me know. I am thinking of chartering one for myself. Please be quick. I shall leave it\nto you to inform me; otherwise I shall keep it to myself for time does not allow one to wait\nfor an answer.\n\nThe answer about the premium on the Coninck David will have to be awaited at leisure,\nbut please tell them to hurry up the business. I do not think that I ought to bear the interest\nwhilst the consignment is not credited to me. It is due to you, but it must be found from that\nitem for I have already paid for it here and so far I have had nothing out of it but trouble. I\nlong to know what the item will yield.\n\nIf the business of Townley is not settled yet, please let me know. I shall then write to Mr T.\nso that he can persuade those good people to make an end of it.\n\nMy correspondent at Lisbon is Nicholas Simons, consul of His Majesty [the King] of\nSweden. I am sure it will be more advantageous for him to draw bills on us here than on\nLondon, though I do not know what the exchange rate on London is. You should be able to\ncalculate what the rate was on drafts in the spring. For the English salt ships the exchange on\nus here was at 61g [per cruzado].\n\nThe insurance rate here on Stockholm is 10 per cent. Our ships, which are due to come\nfrom Stockholm, are taking rather longer than I had expected so I am running a little short.\nThus I trust you will permit me to draw \u00a3500 \u2014\u00a3600 on you against drafts falling due. If the\neffects of mine which you have do not cover it when it falls due I shall make it up some other\nway.\n\nPlease let Negrinus(3) have another \u00a320 and help him sort things out so that he can be\ncertain of getting his papers over before the spring.\n\nThe letters from Denmark have arrived but bring no further news with them. The\nSwedish army draws further offand those at Hamburg write for certain that Malmo has been\nrelieved and that the Danes are afraid that Sweden might well enter Bleking and besiege\n\nCarelstadt.\nWherewith I remain, &c.\n\n[P.S.I I have today revoked a bill of exchange for \u00a3100 from Exeter so it must not be\naccepted. I beg you to guarantee that amount and send the bill and the protest to Isaac van\nHoegarden at Limerick so he can put things in order. Ifacceptance is lacking the holder of the\nbill will speak to you.",

First, Sir, I begg your acceptance of my harty congratulation of your happy\nmarriage (the which have been advised from England) wishing you all imaginable joy and\nprosperity.

    "TEXT": "Above is a copy of my last letter. Since then I have had nothing from you, although I have\nheard that several others have had letters from you.\nThis serves mainly to say that I have the opportunity to make a contract with Willem\nMomma about getting a quantity of brass manufactured at his works, for 600 slb or more, up\nto a total of 1.200 slb per annum, which is as much as his works can produce as long as he is\nrunning them. The works are managed in the name of his brother-in-law,(1) who is regarded\nas an honourable man and who holds a privilege from the King that the products\nmanufactured at the works cannot be seized because of Mommia\u2019s debts but remain at the\ndisposal of the owners. The conditions of the contract are that one must deliver copper at\nNyk\u00f6ping and three months later one will receive back the same amount of brass-wire,\npaying 25 dollars per slb for the cost of manufacture. So far others have had things made on\nsimilar conditions and have been successful, so I am thinking about undertaking it too, even\nthough it means negotiating with Jacob Reenstierna on the same basis. It will give both me\nand my brothers considerable worry to be involved in both works at the same time.\n\nI thought it might be a good idea to suggest to you that you might like to take a half share\nin the quantity contracted with Momma\u2019s brother-in-law for one year or longer, if you\nthought it advisable. We could then keep it in our hands, for it is a good brand and, according\nto the present price of copper, the copper-wire should cost us only about 250 dollars, which\nmeans we ought to be able to have it free on board for 282 or 283 dollars, which should yield a\ngood pennyworth of profit in view of the advantageous rate of exchange. Please give it\ncareful consideration and if you should decide to take part I will serve you for a reasonable\ncommission and the goods belonging to your share will be loaded just as you order. I have not\nyet written to my brothers about making this proposal, so you could discuss it with them and convey your decision to me through them, wherewith I remain, &c.",

They are of various brands such as \u2018the Crown\u2019, \u2018the Rose\u2019,\n\u2018the Lily\u2019, \u2018the Three Crowns\u2019 and also some of the \u2018Crowned N\u2019 mark, but how much of\ncach and what varieties I cannot quite discover, though as far as I can understand they are\nmostly 4-and 5-band. Few of the Swedish wire-sizes have been awaited here but those which\nsomeone has taken sold for 69 ML per 100 lb. and one will hardly get them for less. Swedish\ngarcopper is at RD 61 per slb, Hamburg wire is at 70 ML per 100 lb., copper kettles at RD 70\nand sheet-copper RD 674 per slb. Barbary copper is not sold for cash here but is usually\nbartered against sheet-copper and the like, with about RD 20 per slb thrown in according to\nhow good it is and how well refined. But if you want to know about the sale and demand for\nsheet-copper, I think it should not do badly. Please give it careful consideration.\n\nA ship was ready to depart for Bilbao before the winter but has been prevented by the ice. I\nbelieve it will have another opportunity to go as soon as the waters re-open. Yellow Danzig\nwax sells for 24 1/4-1/2g, and seems to be in good demand. If you want some of this commodity\nplease feel free to command me. God knows, I have a thorough knowledge of it and will\nendeavour to serve you in this or any other commodity to your greatest advantage.\n\nThomas Whayman is loading up for Rouen and will hurry off as soon as the waters here\nare clear, which will take at least three weeks although it is thawing quickly. William Cutler\nis lying here at Dockenhooven! on the Elbe and is all right.\n\nConcerning the Swedish wire: if you would like some I think it would be best if you gave\nthe order sooner rather than later as it will soon be bought up.\n\nI am glad you found that you agreed with the account I sent and have madea record of it. I\nhave checked your account of the 10 sacks of cotton and my current account, found them\ncorrect and have noted my agreement.\n\nI shall wait to hear by your next letter if you have obtained the little parcel of Barbary\nalmonds within my price limits. As you said, plenty are expected and I doubt whether those\nwho own them will be in a good position. If you cannot obtain them at 37s I do not want\nthem, and if you have no success with them you would do well to have obtained a good bale\nof Ardasse below 9s. Let me know for certain in your next. For your news of what is\nhappening in one trade or another I am most grateful and beg you to keep me informed of\nany pending changes, and also of the departure hither of Barker and Lawson, for my\nguidance.\n\nEnclosed herewith is the first copy of a bill of exchange for \u00a3150 sterling at 2 usances and 8\ndays, payable by Jacques Crop, assigned here by Samuel Zum Vorbrock. Please procure its\nacceptance and keep it by you until further order. I intend that B. Sirps shall make good the\nletter-postage for Debora van der Eckholt.

    "TEXT": "Your letter of the 26th of January only reached me yesterday. I am delighted that Steven de\nGeer, whom I have long served, has recommended me to you.\n\nI have noted that Captain John Chapman, sailing the ship Tomazine laden with wine from\nBordeaux, has already left Bordeaux and also that Captain John Garret of the ship Concordia,\ncoming from St Ubes with salt, was ready to depart so that, God willing, they might arrive\nhere soon and that I should accommodate them with money\u2014to which I say that as soon as\nthey arrive I shall not only supply them with the required toll-money as well as the ships\u2019\nexpenses but give them counsel and do as much as possible to assist them. And, if God\npermits, I shall at once inform you of their arrival and, in accordance with your request, keep\nseparate accounts of what I have to pay for the cargo and for the ships\u2019 expenses.\n\nBut all English, Scottish or Irish captains who pass the Sound have the liberty (as long as\nthey are in credit) to pay the un-free Sound toll on their return journey from the Baltic, with\nthe condition that the merchant to whom they are recommended here must enter into a\npledge to the English Resident that, in the event of the captain not returning (which God\nforbid), they will immediately pay the Sound toll themselves. But since you say that I should\npay it, and make no mention of using this English custom [so that nothing need be given here\nif the English style is used](1) I shall follow your instructions unless you manage to order me to\nuse the English right or style before the captains arrive to pass the Sound.\nAn Englishman has to pay here for his ship\u2019s expenses:\n\nA Dutchman, or whoever he may be, pays altogether as above, with the exception of the\npayment to the English Resident. And if any captain arriving at the toll-post to pay for his\nlicence has no specie rixdollars he has to pay a premium on Danish crowns or cross-rixdollars\nof 3s per rixdollar. Before, he used to pay 4s but I have never had to charge my friends\u2019\naccounts with more than 4s\u2014that is, 2s per rixdollar. If it should happen that a large fleet of\nships all arrive together and bank-money is in demand, then it could cost 25s per rixdollar,\nthough that happens rarely. However, the exchange rate at Copenhagen and here usually\ndiffers by 1, or 14 or 2 per cent, because there are few \u2018givers\u2019 here but mostly \u2018takers\u2019, and as\nsoon as the captains arrive the money must be immediately ready, and that causes the\ndifference. Thus one always has to dance to the toll-officers\u2019 pipe, as they well know, and the\ncaptains dare not blink an eye or they will be held up. However, come what may, I shall make\nyour payments and you may be assured that none of your ships, on safe arrival, will be\nneglected for one quarter hour but everything required of me will be done properly. I hope\nto conduct myselfin such a way that I shall earn your desire not merely to continue using me\nhere but to recommend me to others of your friends.\n\nIf you also desire me to send you every post-day, or every 8 or 14 days, a notice of the out-\ngoing or in-coming ships, of whatever nationality they may be, and where they may be\ngoing as well as what their cargo consists of, I shall gladly do it. As soon as I know your mind\nI will agree with one of the Sound-toll officials about how much I should give him for the\nnotification of what I request; and since the toll-officials are not allowed to do it, except in\nsecret, it would be well if it were kept quiet\u2014for your information.\n\nGod be praised! We have had open waters here for the last eight or ten days, and five days\nago a Bremen ship, which lay at Copenhagen all winter, came out of the Baltic and passed the\nSound on its way to Bremen. And now, four days ago, two Copenhagen ships which trade to\nSpain arrived in the road-stead. They are Jacob Maertens Cloodt of the ship Charlotte Amalie,\nmounting 28 guns, as well as Pieter de Verver of Copenhagen, sailing the ship Christiaen\nQuintus with 30 guns, both destined for St Ubes and from there to Lisbon. As soon as the wind is favourable they are thinking of setting off, in God\u2019s name. This for your information,\n&c.\n\nIn my opinion, first to Lisbon, then to St Ubes.",

    "TEXT": "For lack of anything to say we have not written to you for a long time, but we find ourselves\nwith two of your welcome letters of the 5th and 16th past from which we see that you spoke\nto Adam Groenen about the pack which was left lying at the water-side and that he has had it\nfetched away so that it can be sent to our brother-in-law Jean Meinss by a well-known\ncaptain as soon as the waters open. We shall look forward to that, thanking you meanwhile\nfor all the trouble you have taken and also for the information about that well-known person,\nand furthermore for all the news and advice about prices and various wares.\n\nAt the moment we can find nothing profitable to do because of a lack of sales and because\nthe rate of exchange remains obstinately high. If it had fallen to about 33s we would have\nremitted something for our account so that when it came up for payment we could consider\nhow best to employ it, but because the exchange has been for some time at 34s 9-10g, and\ntoday is still at 34s 7g at double usance, we have not found it advisable to remit at such a high\nprice, all the more so as we do not know how to use the money. You advised us to dispose of\nour Barbados commodities since their ships are expected by May with an abundance of\ngoods. We have partly done so, and have sold the sugar, which we had been keeping for so\nlong, at 6g per lb. Yet it seems we were not wise to do so for it looks as if sugar is going to rise\nsince it is beginning to be scarce here and in Holland. The stocks in Portugal are also not large,\nand those of black ginger have also been bought up. Ten or twelve sacks at a time could\nhardly be had for 4 1/2g but are now selling for 4 3/4g, and how it will develop only time will tell.\nCampeachy wood remains at 7 3/4 ML per 100 lb.; indigo guatemalo at 6 3/4\u20147s flem.; fine\ncaribbean indigo is at 5s flem., and Aleppo galls are at 40 to 41 ML per 100 lb.; pepper is\nselling in batches of 10 to 20 sacks at 11 3/4g per lb., and in batches of 3 to 4 sacks is not to be had\nfor less than 12g. It is a low price. We have a reasonable amount of it by us as we have been\nbuying it at one time or another while the price got lower and lower in order to offset the\nhigher-priced stuff, but it has all been at a loss and we dare not order any more. Fine dry wax\nsells here at 23 1/2g flem. and fine Turkish Angora yarn is sold by the English here at 7 1/2s flem.\nCurrants are at 19 to 20 ML per 100 lb. and oil is rather more keenly priced as it is all in strong\nhands. Seville and Portuguese oil sells at RD 60 to 62 while Apulian oil is at RD 6s per 820 lb.\nGrains are very dull and choice rye can be had for RD 52 per last. A quantity is expected from\nHull and other places, and it is likely to fall to RD 50, if not below, for there seems to be big\nsupplies. 400 lasts are expected from Magdeburg in three or four days, so some people are\ngoing to lose a lot of money. Buying up almonds is not going to make any great profit.\nArdasse at 9s per lb. of 24 ounces is not too dear. When the exchange was not so adverse we\nstill had one bale of it lying unsold which you had supplied us with some time ago, but\nbecause it was so coarse people would not have it, which is very annoying. The price here is at\n13 to 13 1/4s flem. with 102 per cent discount, which is very low.\n\nBecause of this burdensome war, trade is falling away in Germany and everywhere else,\nand at the moment we see little prospect of a peace. The river is now open again, however,\nand we see that one or two ships from France have arrived off the city, so we must hope that\nthis will put some life into trade. Please let us know if there is any change at [London] in the\nprices of sugars, pepper, ginger, indigo, galls, Ardasse and the like, for which we shall be most\ngrateful. If we perceive anything profitable and if the exchange begins to be more moderate we shall not neglect to give you some commissions, wherewith our friendliest regards, &c.",

With regard to iron I am also of the\nopinion that its price will remain steady in Sweden, partly because many works have had to\nremain at a standstill through lack of water and have made only a half of what they are\naccustomed to produce; and partly because so many English ships have been chartered to go\nto St Ubes that there will be a shortage of return ladings.\n\nI have contracted for about 1.500 slb of \u2018O\u2019 iron, which I shall keep to myself, so you\ncannot expect any to come this summer unless I have about 400-500 slb of the 1.500, which is\nlying ready, despatched in the chartered salt ships. The rest will come straight here, and if\nyour iron prices improve somewhat I can have some \u2018G\u2019 iron shipped to you, which the\nwholesalers are also familiar with. So, of the two brands, none will get into other hands than\nyours, and it will take some time this summer before you are able to sell what you have.\n\nNow, as regards the 'L' iron which, as I mentioned previously, had not yet been\ncontracted for\u2014I shall not be doing so this time because that brand is not so very well-known\n[in England] and because the raw material is not available. It used to be made from one ore,\nbut as the old mine is now finished and the new one is not so good at first, it may well be a\nyear before the ore begins to be as good as it was. There is no more of the old ore near the 'L'\nworks. There is some round about the \u2018O\u2019 works which is being mixed with the new ore, and\nat the \u2018G\u2019 works there is mostly old ore, so that is now turning out best\u2014voila! on nous\nenformes pour vos gouverno.\n\nEveryone says that the number of ships going to Stockholm is 18 or 20, and I am sure that\nmany will not find it worthwhile, particularly if they all arrive at Stockholm together and\nhave to leave together. We must first see how things go in the spring. Apart from two or\nthree ships which are now about to arrive from St Ubes, there are so many others that it may\nwell be September or October before the Dutch ships will be able to arrive, for in April they\nfirst have to go to St Ubes, and I calculate the number going either to the Baltic or here is at\nleast 50 vessels, which will result in very slow loading.\n\nIf Mr Scheurman comes here I shall be able to learn from him how it will affect the\nfreedom of the ships if they bring wine as well as other goods which are expected every hour.\nBut of your ships I shall make no mention.\n\nJe vous remercie pour vos nouvelles. It will be an extraordinary summer if it continues as it\nhas begun with Valenciennes(1)\u2014such a strong and substantial city taken at the first assault, so\nunexpectedly for besiegers and besieged! And now it is the turn of Cambrai. Who knows what may follow, for this year of '77 may bring forth some strange things. I remain, &c.",

Likewise Mr Green has had no letters from you so far and has no idea what\nhas happened regarding the goods in John Stabler and their insurance, nor what has happened\nabout those loaded in William Evelyn since you mentioned little about them in your latest\nletters. I hope that Evelyn has since arrived and that the goods have found a good market, so\nthat I can be encouraged to continue trading to England in future.\n\nSo far I have got little in stock, because my debtors have not kept their word. The reason is\nthat, with the present demand for copper-wire, they have obtained from others better\nconditions than those they agreed to with me, as a result of which the proposal to have it\nmanufactured by Willem Momma cannot go ahead since it has been necessary to take the said\nMomma to court. In addition, copper has risen to 228 and 238 dollars per slb. Undoubtedly\nthis will continue as little has been worked. At Norrk\u00f6ping production has only just begun\nand at Nyk\u00f6ping only seven forges are working. But the Cronstr\u00f6m and Rosenstr\u00f6m works\nare being driven hard, though most of it is being made by Cronstr\u00f6m who has contracted\nwith Van C\u00f6llen & Uppendorff. And because copper is at a high price abroad the copper-\nwire made at Hamburg can hardly be sold for any trifling price.\n\nBecause of the continual frost and lack of water that we had in the new year most iron-\nworks have been ata standstill, so little iron will be produced this spring and iron of ordinary\nquality is selling here at 27 to 28 dollars per slb.

Isee that trade in iron has been going badly. Iron prices here are high at 28 to 29 dollars.\nDuring the winter I bought about 3.000 slb of 3-inch iron and t-inch square iron which I am\nexpecting here from the works as soon as the rivers are open. May God bring them safely. I\nshall sell it all here. But I have also bought 300 slb of garcopper during the winter which I am\nhaving made mostly into wire, but\u2014God willing \u2014I shall send you a quantity and I shall\nsend it in your name. But the English Resident here has to give the captains a note or\ncertificate that the ship and the goods are English and that the merchant is truly English, so\neveryone must declare on demand that the goods in the ship are strictly English. If you could\nwrite to the Resident to give me a certificate that the goods I have loaded are for your\naccount, as is everything I have loaded, then the Resident is likely to help me. As you are\ngetting 2 per cent you could well declare them to be your own and answer for them. Besides,\nI shall also be ordering all kinds of English merchandise, such as all sorts of cloth serges and\nbays, and as soon as I know that you have got me free to leave Stockholm waters I shall be\nwanting something from you. However, I intend to pay freight and duties here myselfat the\nrate of 12 per cent though, as you know, I could put it under our Swedish names if I have to\nmake use of other friends. I await your answer to this.\n\nI see that Capt. Nicolas Payton has arrived safely at Harwich, God be praised! I hope he\nwill soon reach London and deliver the 350 coils of brass-wire which he has for you. I trust\nyou will do your best for me. I am in no great hurry for the money and only want you to seek\nthe highest possible price. I also expect at the earliest opportunity an account of the 1.280 coils\nwhose proceeds, I see, amount to \u00a31.666. I had expected \u00a3100 more. I hope that the\nRD 6.751 23s Dutch current-money has been remitted to our friends in Amsterdam,\nalthough I dearly wish it had been remitted net, as I ordered, for I have ascribed it to our friend that way in my books.

    "TEXT": "I received your letter of the 29th of February from Captain Jan Garret of the ship Concordia\nwhen he arrived at Setubal (God be praised) together with six others from [England] four or\nfive days ago. The order to let him have a suitable cargo of Setubal salt was also received and\nwill be performed according to instructions. As regards the good measure and quality of the\nsalt, together with the promptness of its despatch, you may rest assured that no one will be\nmore advantageously dealt with, but the fourteen days allowed for loading are too short for\nany satisfactory despatch, for it must necessarily take a month, and even if one could get it\nclear in less than a month one would have to wait for his accompanying ships, which will\nneed to have at least four or five weeks. Please bear in mind in future that it is no use limiting\nthe captain to twelve or fourteen days, more or less, if it states in the charter-party that he is to\nleave in company with others. Furthermore, I am quite sure that I can give better despatch\nand as much speed as anyone if he is loaded in a more leisurely way, which also permits one\nfurther advantage in the measurement of the salt.\n\nThe price of the salt and the accompanying costs are always agreed at Setubal and there has\nbeen no change in them for the last fourteen or fifteen years. However, during times when\nthere are 50 or 60 ships together loading, they sometimes have to remain lying there for eight\nor ten weeks; and it sometimes happens that when the opportunity arises to join suitable,\ngood company which would allow some of the ships to depart, or they decide to join a\nforeign convoy, they will spend \u00a350 or \u00a360 for the benefit of speedy despatch. But the same\nhaste often occasions great prejudice in the measure and quality of the salt. Otherwise, as I\nsaid above, the charges and the price of the salt are always agreed. Here at Lisbon the price\nfollows the market, though it is usually cheaper than at Setubal where the measure and\nquality of the salt is more advantageous and better than that here\u2014for your advice.\n\nI had news from Mons. Steven de Geer at least three or four weeks ago that you had\nchartered the above-mentioned ship, and probably yet more. On their arrival your orders\nwill be punctually followed, but there seldom occurs any opportunity to draw bills on\n[London] which has to be done on Amsterdam where the rate of exchange is also more\nfavourable. At present it is at 62 to 62 1/2g [flem. per cruzado]. Whether the total costs of the\nabove-mentioned ship are drawn on De Geer (as he instructed) though by way of [London]\nor Amsterdam, it will always be by the most favourable rate, the success of which you will\nlearn in due course.\n\nSince Swedish shipping has been prevented from coming here by this dreadful war there is\na great shortage here of all Swedish wares. Iron could at present fetch between 3.000 and\n3,200 reis per quintal of 128 lb. A Swedish shippound counts for about 294 lb. here, and on\neach quintal falls about 450 reis duty and charges. Deals, according to size and quality, are 30\nto 40 to 45 crowns(1) per 122 pieces; beams are likewise (according to quality) 500 to 1,500 and\n2,000 reis per piece. Masts of 15 to 24 palms are, one with another, 70,000 reis per piece. Tar,\n3,000 reis per tun\u2014free on duty and charges since the purchaser usually pays these. Only with\niron is it customary for the owner to pay the duty and expenses\u2014for your guidance.\n\nI take the liberty of troubling you further with a bill of exchange for \u00a388 12s sterling at\n8 days sight drawn on Johan Crogher, value of myself though stated pro forma from Pieter\nMeyer, arising from an assignment which the said Crogher received from Sam. Sowton\ndrawn on one, Thomas Thussen, iron dealer in [London] in payment of a bill of exchange\npassed for my account on the said Sowton. Now a year and a day has passed during which the\nsaid Crogher has kept me waiting, notwithstanding that I have written to him several times\nand exhorted him through a friend in Amsterdam but he never answered a single letter, only\nwriting occasionally a note to the friend in Amsterdam and putting him off with fair\npromises. At last he wrote to my friend on the 12th/22nd of December last year, informing\nhim that he had received the proceeds of the assignment from Thussen and that he would\nremit the total to me through his brother, Captain William Crogher, at a rate of exchange of\n6s 7\u20148d per mil reis, together with other small details, for which I have been waiting. Now his\nbrother has arrived at Setubal with these latest ships from [England], but with no letter, no\nnews, much less any remittance from Crogher, which is very un-mannerly. I beg you to\nobtain friendly satisfaction for the aforesaid bill of exchange and after deducting something\nfor commission and similar small expenses remit the remainder to me here so that I can at\nleast get something. The enclosed letter to him is going open, which you may close at\npleasure, forgiving me for troubling you with such small matters. I remain, always ready and\nwilling to serve you in anything you may be pleased to command as De Geer is so close a friend, yours &c.\n\n[P.S.] Mr. Steven de Geer has also ordered me to load three boxes of china apples, marked\n\u2018L.D.\u2019, which are loaded with the other three you ordered.",

    "TEXT": "Your letters of the 26th of September, 25th of January and oth of February have just been\nreceived all together. As for that of the 26th of September, there is nothing which needs to be\nsaid except that Mr Boor has given me the answer that he remitted the 1.755 d[ollars] 16 [\u00f6re]\nto Rouen more than three months ago and has also had news that it was accepted, so there is\nnothing to be done about that bill of exchange though it will be retained until further order\nbecause letters are going so unreliably now. It is strange that until now you have received\nnothing from either of the bills of exchange which I remitted to you on the 18th of October,\nnamely \u00a3140 and \u00a3100 on William Benson, whereof I sent the first and the second copies.\nWhen I come to Stockholm I shall send the third copy if I receive no further news from you\nmeanwhile.\n\nSo far I have been able to learn nothing from your agent. My servant writes me that he has\ntravelled to Fahlund(1) so I wrote to learn what his intentions were. I have now written to him\nagain that he should find out through Thomas Perman and Oloff Hansson if he wants to load\nany wire for your account in the Thomazine so that there is room for it. Regarding these\npersons, I know nothing other than that they are good, especially Oloff Hansson whom I\nknow to handle good and great affairs with promptness. The other I do not know so well,\nthough I do not doubt his reliability. I shall keep a wakeful eye open to watch your interests,\nnotwithstanding that these folk are adequate enough.\n\nRegarding the ship with wine, as soon as it arrives I shall do my best to take care of it and\nfollow all your orders and communicate with your agent. I had thought that one would be\nable to get this cargo in as Swedish, duty-free, but I have now received news that this cannot\nbe, because this year no goods or ships will enjoy Swedish duty-freedom. If this should be the\ncase for the ships bringing salt it will fall very heavily on the goods coming in and going out\non the Thomazine, as it makes a difference of one-third in the duty. I now hope that a further\norder will come asa decision about it has been deferred by the King. It is to be feared that the\nship will arrive at just the moment when there will be an embargo on all shipping since it\nappears that our war-flect will be in the Daalders(2) at about that time. If such is the case, and if\none cannot enjoy the full freedom from duties, I do not think it will be advisable to load this\nship for your account, because even if the first eventuality does not occur it will be burdened\nwith the high duty, and it would be better if your returns were loaded in the salt-ship as long\nas the increase in the toll is in prospect. However, I shall always act for your greatest\nadvantage as circumstances offer and as soon as the Concordia has arrived I shall take good care\nthat it is fully laden by others. Mr Boor will also have a consignment to load. I shall do my\nbest to sell the wine for cash as far as possible, but so far as I can learn from others these goods\nare not often sold wholesale for cash. Now that the returns need not be held up I shall be able\nto go to Stockholm immediately at the end of the month, so your agent can meanwhile prepare everything. Wherewith regards, &c.",

We have checked\nit and find that the customs, scavage, passport and town duties amount to a great deal and are\nmuch above our estimate. Madame your wife and Mr Peter Joye, in the year 1672, when we\nsent them 400 coils from here, only brought \u00a332 16s into the account for customs, scavage,\npassport and town duties, but for these 1.650 coils you put down \u00a3167 5s, which differs\nconsiderably. Please check it again and if you find a mistake please correct it, as well as\ndeducting the extra 4 per cent commission which you have incorrectly put down. Our\nbrother David wrote to us that he had agreed with you that you would only charge 14 per\ncent in the account for the brass consigned to you by John Green. Otherwise we have found\nno error in the account, which we are returning herewith so that you can correct it and\ninterline what has been omitted.\n\nWe see that, instead of having any money for us in cash, you are actually out of pocket.\nThe exchange is now too low for discounting any bill. However, we thank you for your offer\nto continue serving us in the disposal of our remaining copper-wire before the arrival of new\nwire from Sweden. It is welcome, but if it cannot be arranged and other people begin to\nundercut our prices for that commodity you will please not follow them too closely as we are\nnot willing to have ours sold for less than \u00a36 5s, for your guidance.\n\nWe are glad that you have sent the remaining kettles to Rouen in accordance with our\norder, and have credited us with the f.192.15.8 bank-money paid to Vincent Maillant,\nremaining herewith, &c.",

I have\nalso the account which you sent with them, and the letter of the 23rd of November which\nyou said was sent via your servant. It was delivered by Mr Klitzert,(1) and from your servant I\nhave heard nothing. And I understand from your letters that none of mine have come to your\nhands which I wrote on the 24th of August, the 5th of October, the 16th of October (under\ncover of Mr Klitzert) and the last of 11th of December under cover of Mr Perman (as I\nsupposed). I am astonished that you should have received none of them.\n\nComing now to reply, I must say that I have partly checked your account and find that\nyou have left out RD 2.000, which you paid long ago to Mr De Geer, which was properly\nentered into my books in conformity with your letters, and entered it shall remain. If you\nfind yourself falling short on other items they ought not to have been sold in that manner. I\ncan also not approve of the bad debts, for you wrote nothing to me about them between 1672\nand 1675, although the account was settled annually. The last time you sold anything to John\nSkepper(2) was in 1672 and it was over a year before anything was paid, when you credited\nhim with \u00a353 7s 4din 1673. Now I happen to know that others sold to him in 1674 and have\nbeen paid, and it was not until 1675 that he absconded, in which time one could have easily\ndemanded the debt. I corresponded for a long time with your predecessors, Jan de Buck and\nMarescoe, and before that with their employer, Mr Jacques Bove, but I have never\nencountered anything like this in these unseasonable times. You have also reckoned all the\ninterest on the debts at 6 per cent though you know it should be only 5 per cent. I know\nperfectly well that you should not have to carry bad debts, but I know even better that one\nought not to be kept in suspense but be informed in a business-like style, annually on the\nclosing of accounts, of any outstanding debts\u2014of which, during four years, I was told\nnothing. So please understand that I shall not close this account until everything is sold and\nthe final total agreed. Then we can reckon the interest as it ought to be, so please make an end\nof the sale as soon as possible.\n\nI was greatly misled when I was told in writing that one could sell 400 slb per annum of\nblack kettles, or the like, and thus to send so many pots to England which you were to sell to\nthe Guinea Company or to Spanish or Muscovy merchants. It is a good product, and what I\nhave had manufactured recently I have been selling at Stockholm to the Russians and get\nmore for them than I would abroad. You will please make an end of them and not quibble\ntoo much about the price, but do not sell to people who are unreliable about paying, as\nSkeppart was. I would not be insisting on this if you had kept your fine words to have a\nwatchful eye, as you could and ought to have had over the last three or four years.\n\nIt is unnecessary to write any more, as you can be better informed from your correspondents at Stockholm about the way trade is. At this place there is nothing to be done,\nand I commend you, with regards, &c.\n\n[P.S.] If you participated last year in sending calamine here from Amsterdam, please inform\nme as I have previously requested.",

    "TEXT": "On the 9th of March and the 27th past we received our Hendrico\u2019s letters from [England],\nsaying that he had arrived there safely on the 25th of November last year. And as he has had\nthe honour of being consulted by you regarding trade he has requested us to give you advice\nabout what is happening to it here. Thus we take this opportunity of free postage by the\ndeparture of six French ships (two for Leghorn and four for Marseille) to trouble you with\nour notes about the goods which are called for here from [England], as well as about those\nwhich are sent from here to [England]. In addition we describe some assortments of Dutch\nlinens, perpetuanas and calculations about linens with 28 stuiver coins and also Dutch steel.\nFrom these you will be able to see what you may profitably turn to account. If you should be\ninclined to make a trial of one thing or another we beg that we may be favoured. You may be\nassured that you will be so well satisfied that you will want to continue.\n\nFirstly, the principal goods brought here from [England] are \u2018Londons\u2019 \u2014of three sorts, each\nselling according to its quality, which are called perpetuanas\u2014lead, and iron wire as well as\nother goods which you can see from the enclosed note. The goods which [England] most\ndemands from here are silks (Ardasse, Legis or Serbassi) Angora or Beybesar yarn, cotton wool\nand cotton yarn, gall-nuts, testick-wax,(1) or hoeden wol, aniseed and [\u2014blank\u2014].\n\nSecondly, the goods from Holland on which a good penny-worth can be gained are the\nsmallest cloths, Danzig-steel, brown gum-lack, stockings of grey \u2018bont-werk\u2019,(2) and (above all)\nmost preferred are Dutch textiles which one must exchange against Turkish yarn from\nAngora or Beybesar and against cotton-wool, gall-nuts, aniseed, testick, mastic, palm-wood\nand wax; also against silk (Ardasse, Legi and Serbassi). In bartering for [silk] one must always\nprovide half the value in money, and for all other goods one-third in cash, so that the costs of\nfreight, consular charges and other sorts of outgoing and incoming goods can be paid for.\nThe most useful and profitable specie are Lion dollars which are currently being struck in\n[England] and sent here in large quantities, together with 22-, 26- and 28-stuiver coins out of\nHolland, which are packed in between the cloths. One can make a good profit on these coins,\nas well as on Danzig-steel which can be got in Holland for f.10 or f.11 per hundred pounds,\nfree on board. The latter is presently selling here for LD 8 1/4 per cantar(3) and is sometimes at\nLD 10 or LD 11 according to the amount in town. Gum-lack is LD 1 1/4 per oque,(4) grey bont-\nwerk stockings are LD 6 1/2 to 7 per hundred, first-quality cotton-wool LD 7 and second-\nquality LD 5 3/4 per cantar.\n\nFor further news of what is happening in the course of trade please look at the\naccompanying price-current, and\u2014as we have said\u2014if you are disposed to see some\nadvantage in making a trial we beg that we may have the honour. You will have satisfaction\nand enjoy quick returns, as time will tell.\n\nSix days ago we reccived letters from a friend saying that the great Sultan had publicly\nentered Constantinople in unusual pomp together with his mother and the Grand Vizier.(5)\nNobody here had believed it would happen. And as the great man is now trying to keep his\nhead he has demanded the head of his brother, but since his mother is very protective of him\nno one knows how it will turn out. Two days after the said great lord entered Constantinople\nhe forbade any women to be scen on the streets any more and one afternoon, sitting in his\nseraglio by the sea-side he saw sailing by some vessels with women, which ran aground. He\nhad the poor women drowned. If things go on like this one must wonder what is coming\nnext.\n\nFor the last five days there has been seen here, for three hours every midnight, a comet-star\nrising in the north-east among the stars on high. It is about an ell long and hovers a little\ntowards the due-north. What this may signify the good Lord alone knows, to whom I pray\nthat He may keep you in good health, and closing, remain, &c.",

Since then I have only just\nreceived, yesterday, yours of the 12th of April from which I see what you have to say about\nthe copper coins. As it is now forbidden to export them I can send no great quantity.\nNevertheless I have ordered them to send you some from Gothenburg and will write in the\nmorning (God willing) that they are not to send you more than 4 or 5 tuns. However, I\nremain of the opinion that this commodity must rise and hold its price since no garcopper of\nany importance can be sent from here as long as one has to pay the un-free duty\u2014which\nmeans that not one shippound of garcopper can go from here for less than 450 dollars\u2014\nwhich, reckoning the \u00a31 sterling at 25 dollars, means \u00a318. Now, as soon as you receive it\nfrom Gothenburg I shall be glad to learn at once what can be done with it. At present wire\ncosts 290 dollars per shippound; iron is at 30 to 32 dollars, which are good prices, and voyage\niron is 33 dollars, so I do not think that one can send any iron to [England] if one wants to\nrecover the money invested. Things are very bad here with regard to freedom from duties.\nWhoever brings in no salt, ammunition or ordinary woven cloth must pay the un-free duty,\nwhich makes a difference of at least 3 RD on a shippound of wire. Consequently business is\nquite extraordinary here at present.\n\nYour 2.000 coils of wire will have been sold long ago. If not, you should sell them at once\nas 3.000 coils are going from here to [England]. So far, little has gone for L\u00fcbeck, Hamburg,\nFrance or Holland, but I shall be sending some to these places in order not to spoil the market\nin [England]. It will be explained to you more fully in our next letters that Mr Van C\u00f6llen\nand I have separated and that from now on you are to accept nothing for our partnership\nunless it is signed by us both in our own writing. Please bear this in mind.\n\nWith regard to anything I may send you (which could be considered as sold, free-on-\nboard, when it is delivered) I shall draw nothing on you before the ship leaves the Daalders.\n\nI am delighted that the business is going forward in Parliament(1) and look forward to\nhearing the outcome at your convenience, wherewith\u2014besides offering my unqualified\nservices\u2014I send warm regards to you, your wife and whole family, remaining, &c.",

It is astonishing how things are going in Sweden with\nregard to the purchase of iron, the English buying everything that appears for 30 dollars per\nshippound. My brother has sold 3.000 to 4.000 slb of his 'L' on commission for that much\nand Boor has also sold some of my \u2018O\u2019 and others besides similarly.

I would\nguess that when these ships arrive in London there will be not a little undercutting in iron\nprices, so I think it would be most advisable if you sold what you have of mine before the\nships arrive and iron gets into too many hands. As for pan-iron we must look into it. There\nwill be little or nothing coming this year so it should eventually find its buyers, but we must\nlet it lie for a while and be patient.\n\nIt is now too late to have 13- and 13-inch iron made. If only I had had your letter earlier,\nthere were 300 slb lying at Stockholm which have now been shipped to [blank].\n\nI shall now be getting some letters from Sweden which I am sure will yield a bad account\nunless Cletcher has bought tar for you in good time, for I am afraid there has been too much\nin the country.\nMr Botte tells me that he has acquired for himself all the tar that goes to London, and that\nhe has consigned it all to you so that it remains in few hands.\n\nLet me know if you have anything concerning the wine lading. I see from Boor\u2019s letters\nthat Cletcher has sold the salt for less than 10} dollars. That is too low. Boor has also sold some for me but I think he would have done well to leave it.

It is beyond reason but in these latest letters I have been\ninformed that the English are now buying iron for 30 dollars which was last year selling at\n25 dollars, while the salt which was sold last year at 12 dollars is now selling at 10 1/2. You can\nwell conceive what a difference that makes. One should be able to say that, because it was\nbought up at such a high cost, the price of iron must rise. In other places they would hold on\nto it, but not the English! They must sell, cost what it may, so once again I beg you and order\nyou to sell my iron at the market price, for large amounts will be coming from Sweden.",

It should be sold at 3 months time precisely,\nso that the bills of exchange can be paid; and in order that I may sleep all the sounder I would\nask you to stand liable for debts, which you are better able to settle than anyone, having\nknowledge enough about your customers not to give credit to anyone other than reliable\npeople.\n\nIf you do so I shall:\n\n3. allow you 2 per cent commission, and for interest (according to your demand) 4 per cent\nper month for your outlay on freight charges and bills of exchange.

I have agreed not to draw on you more than \u00a35 per last on the tar and \u00a37 per last on the\npitch from the time the goods arrive until the time when they are sold, when you will always\nallow me to dispose of the balance in such a way that what remains unsold from time to time\nis only charged with \u00a35 per last of tar and \u00a37 per last of pitch, including all expenses.\n\nI have no doubt that these conditions will please you and that you will consent to them,\nhandling the costs as if they were your own, on which I shall rely and await your decision by\n your next letter.

    "TEXT": "My last letter was of the 16th past and went by way of Gothenburg. Since then I have\nreceived yours of the 26th of January and oth of February.\nIn reply, you will have seen by my previous letter that because I am engaged in a suit with\nWillem Momma the proposal I made to you cannot be put into effect. I now see that you are\nintroducing difficulties by suggesting that the business was hindered because I could not make\nup my mind to participate on grounds that are no concern of mine. With regard to the\ninsurance on John Stabler, the reasons you give for the high premium do not satisfy me since\nthe difference between the 4 per cent given by Francis Townley and the 7 per cent given by\nyou on the same ship and at about the same time is too great. It would be a big enough\ndifference if one granted an extra 1 per cent for the reliability of the insurers but in addition\nyou put down another 1 per cent for the clause that, in the event of loss, payment would be\nmade without deduction, and on checking through your earlier letters I find that in one of the\n16th of June 1676 you wrote that such a clause made a difference of only 1/4 per cent; and that\nstill leaves another 1 per cent which you cannot explain.\n\nI beg you to believe that brass-ware is a commodity which needs to be handled with skill. I\ncannot commend anyone who is neglectful about arranging insurance but to give it away in\nhaste and to have no regard to what an insurer puts is also not commendable and takes away a\nlarge part of the profit.\n\nI hope you have done your duty in selling and have made some recompense by selling at a\ngood price. Brass-wire remains at about 270 dollars per shippound, garcopper at 226 to 227 dollars, ordinary fine iron at 28 to 29 dollars and St Ubes salt at 12 dollars per ton. With\nwhich I remain, &c.",

    "TEXT": "I refer myself to my last letter of the 3 1st past. Since then I have been at The Hague for a while\nconcerning business affairs and on coming home found your letters of the 24th, 28th and 31st\nditto, in answer to which I cannot agree to sell any tar for less than \u00a310 10s sterling, be it at\nHarwich or at London, and if our friends will not agree to that please store what belongs to\nme. They can sulk, and they can receive what is due to them if they need it and thus be able\nto pay up all the more promptly. And I am not obliged to follow them because of any\ndisputed points about which they make claims, as set out in your last letter of the 31st of\nAugust. For although I have been assured by the Directors in the contract settled on the 3rd of\nApril this year that for a period of two years they would not sell tar for England to anyone\nbut me, our friends cannot guarantee that no Viborg or Stockholm tar besides mine will\narrive, firstly because it could be stolen and secondly because malicious people here or at\nL\u00fcbeck could buy up assortments and have them sent to [England] in order to make claims,\nfor which I have no desire. So, as I have said before, it is best to sell, which I urge you to do.\n\nIf you cannot arrange any freight charters for Stockholm at \u00a33 sterling per last you do not\nneed to go to any further trouble. I shall wait until next year, and it is much better that one\ndoes not get too much this year in view of the quantities which have arrived from Vastervik\nand are yet expected,\n\nThank you for mentioning the idea of chartering salt ships for St Ubes next year. I shall\nthink about it and may well decide to charter a consignment if it can be obtained at \u00a35\nsterling \u2014i.e. from St Ubes to Stockholm and from there to [London] at eighteen tuns of salt\nper last and a similar lading in return. Let me know more in due course.\n\nIn your letter of the 28th of August I have found the account for the cargo in Captain\nRobert Young, consisting of 62 lasts of tar and 20 lasts of pitch, which you have forgotten to\nsign. Please get it right in future. I have checked it and find that you have charged me \u00a35 8s\nfor brokerage, short-change and false money at 3 per cent, which according to my contention\nought not to be charged to me as it is not the practice here and is covered by your\ncommission. For if one has regular tar customers one does not need to deal with brokers, and\nif a cashier receives false money he ought to pay for it, for what he does not see with his eyes\nhe ought to feel in his purse. So I expect you to reimburse me for this item. Secondly, while\nyou have rebated two months from the total proceeds (so that the goods have only yielded\n1 per cent) you have additionally charged me four months interest on expenses totalling\n\u00a3216 95, which is also a mistake. For if you have reckoned the full rate of interest on this\n\u00a3216 9s so much the less ought you to rebate for two months. There is also a mistake of\n\u00a32 35 3d which you will please credit to me. Apart from this I find your account correct.\n\nYou were pleased to tell me that you have written to Mr Cletcher at Stockholm that the\ntar and pitch loaded in the Thomasina were absolutely for your account. Now you may\nremember that you have promised me before to tell no one for whose account these goods\nwere going, so I have said nothing to Mr Cletcher nor anyone else at [Stockholm]. I beg you\nalways to keep it secret, for one does not need to give anyone unnecessary information.\n\nRegarding the hire of a warehouse, I rely on you to arrange it as carefully as possible.\n\nI am glad that, following my instructions, you will not sell the tar for less than \u00a310 10s. I\nshall rely on that, and am in agreement with you onall the conditions so far as concerns debts.\nSince you write that there are only four or five [customers] that one can trust I beg you to let\nme know their names so that I can inform myself about them. I am very apprehensive about\nthis because I have had my fingers burnt before and if you could remove my uneasiness on\nthis score I cannot see anything to sever our correspondence provided that you follow my\ninstructions in selling. I beg you to give it further thought and let me know your good ideas. I\ncan assure you that if we once get our relationship settled on a firm foundation you will be\nable to earn with me a handsome commission.\n\nPlease do not forget to send the Canary sack to Stockholm at the earliest opportunity,\naddressing it to Claes Wilkens, and if you are able to charter some ships, as you said, please\naddress them to Wilkens and to Burghermaster Hans Smitt at Viborg.\n\nI shall not neglect to recommend you to my friends, but it will not be necessary to do so for\nBreda(2) because if I had not had his previous recommendation I would not be corresponding\nwith you now.\n\nWhen the opportunity occurs I beg you to send me sixty bottles of good Canary sack, and\nmake a note of it on my account.\n\nWith regards, I remain, &c.",

I also\nadvised you what difficulty my contra party yett makes about Mr Perman\u2019s and my father\u2019s\nbale, for they will not lett mee have a farthing but put it all in security for the bale, and that\nyou could help mee to bee master of my own if you did send me the bale back againe, then I\nwould put all what I gett in your hands this is about the contents of my last. I have received\nsinc your wellcome lines of the 22 June, where of I doe see that you have not received a word\nof answer on all your letters to mee about your bussinese here, and because your affaires doe\nnot require to keep mee here you give me order to come back by way of Gottenborgh before\nSeptember. For answer, your 3 letters of the 29 December, 16 and 25 January I did not recive\nbefore the 28 of March and sick on my bed occasioned thorrow an onlucky faal I had on my\nright side upon a iron plate which keept mee 3 weeks to bed, and that is the reason I did not\nanswer your letters before the 21 Aprill. Yours of the 26 January with copie of the 25 ditto,\n16 February with copies of the 9 and 13 ditto, 21th March, 2 and 4 Aprill I all received the\n12th May when I came to Stockholm, all which I did answer the 16 ditto per via Gottenborgh\nat large. The 21 May I advised you about William Momma\u2019s bussines, and if you did send\nSpanisch silver for this plase that it would turne to a good account, and 9 June advised you the\narrival of the Concord; 13 ditto the arrivall of Thomasine; 16 ditto the sale of your loading salt;\n23 ditto the contract which I had made with two merchants here, Mr Oloff Root and Thomas\nCupp for a parcell of English manufactuars for about \u00a31.500 sterling att 16 per cent profitt to\nbee delivered eigther here or att Gottenborgh, they paying all charges whatsoever except\nassurance money. I also did send you there\u2019s memorandum for to buy the goods affter. The\n26 July and 10 July sent you also the copie of the 23 June. Sir, this is my declaration both for\nthe time when I received your letters, also when I have answered them, and thought it dos\nnot, may bee, answeer to your expectation yet I doe hope that you will not in the least\ndeminidge your good will you have for mee. Whatsoever I have done amise I pray for it, and\nwhat is to bee mended I will loose noe time to imploy my outmost power for to doc it. It may\nbee that some frinds have seen mee here that went for England, but truly I did not know so\nmuch, for I did write per Gottenborgh which I thought was the securest way and\nrecomended my letters to Mr Robert Clarck that hee should send them away with the very\nfirst opportunity of frinds and ships. If Mr Clarck have not observed my orders but letten the\nletters ly hee is much to bee blamed, for hee aught att least let mee know so much that I might\nhave governe mee there after. Yesterday I did write to him for to know what he has done\nwith my letters.\n\nToward the beginning of September, please God, shall I live in Gottenborgh for to goe for\nEngland if I don\u2019t get contrary orders from you before, and about that time doe I expect those\ngoods I have written for. As soon as the ship Concord is departed this port I doe intend for to\ngoe up in the country for 2 weekes for to settel my affairs in as good a order as I can before I\nreturne for England. By this inclosed letter of Mr Cletcher you shall understand what her\nloading is. You will also have the account of the salt, the neet amounting to 16.143 dollars 6\nore copper mony. Mr Cletcher is gone from hence to his workes at Axberghammer and did\ngive mee order for to make up the account with the master, which I also have done, and has\ngiven meea recept for 1.595 dollars copper monys, where of hee has payd all the port charges,\nThe recept I am orderd to send to Mr Cletcher with the first post. The master has in for your\naccount 40 tillts of deals, which cost with the toll and all 195 dollars 4 ore; 4 fadomes wood to\nstow the tarr cascks cost 28 dollars, the port charges amounting to 481 dollars 18 ore. I should\nhave bought you some good birtch wood but here is non to bee had for mony. However, I\nhave given order to the master thatt in case hee meets any boats with good wood that hee\nshall buy you 4 or 6 fadoms and stow it up from the tarr. The wind has been very good this 8\ndays for Mr Chapman. I hope hee shall have a short voyage. Having noe more to inlarge but\nwisching the ship Concord a good voyage and after my humble service presented to my mistress and the rest of the house I rest, your faithfull servant.\u2019",

    "TEXT": "Although I have nothing of yours to answer, nor any special reason for writing to you, I\ncannot neglect to inform you that Jeremias van Raey, a substantial merchant here, has gone\nbankrupt. I hope you are not implicated, which I shall be relieved to hear. Let this serve as a\nwarning against any further involvement. I am not involved, but more through good luck\nthan judgement. It is indeed lamentable that such a pillar should come to fall, but what can\none say? We live in very miserable times. There have been two or three other small bank-\nruptcies not long ago and as a result one does not know whom one can trust. On the\nExchange credit is entirely dead and one may shortly hear of further failures, so if the Lord is\nnot merciful to us in granting a good peace many honourable folk will be ruined by this\nlengthy and disastrous war. One hears of nothing but losses, and business is so bad that one has\nto run great risks at sea from capers and other dangers. Instead of profits, commodities are\nfrequently yielding losses, for in general business has been ruined and most kinds of\nmerchandize are at such low prices that it is astonishing. Nothing is selling because demand is\nvery poor. The whole of Christendom is troubled and the war has impoverished so many\npeople that wares simply do not sell. There are many folk who, inspired by the low price of\nvarious goods, sent large amounts here in recent years in hopes of a peace and a rise in prices,\nbut they have been greatly deceived in their expectations. The older the goods the more they\nare slighted. Capital is in confusion(1) and we can see no sign of any improvement\u2014enfin, it is\nbetter to sit tight than to invest, and that is the reason why I dare undertake little, for if one\nbalances the risk against the small prospect of profit neither the one nor the other is\nencouraging. May the Lord drive away these dark clouds and give us a long and durable\npeace!\n\nThe burghermasters have allowed Van Raey a free pass so that no one can molest him fora\ngiven time, on the grounds that his business is not in such a bad way but has been overtaken by bills of exchange and some goods have been delayed here and there. The Lord will settle\neverything for the best, to whose protection I commend you and, offering my services,\nremain, &c.",

Since then I have received yours of the 7th, by which I\nsee that you have not yet bought the 10 sacks of Smyrna cotton which I ordered because of a\nlack of ships coming this way. The Elbe here has been full of ice but is now navigable again\nand there are two ships which have arrived here from [England], and since you said that you\nwere arranging for a ship to come here I assume you have performed my commission and\nawait the account and the bill of lading.\n\nI shall maintain the price of your remaining cotton at 14g, for it ought to fetch as muchas it\ncosts in [England], but because it is now an unfavourable time of year one ought to take that\ninto consideration a little and wait until there is further demand. I have sold nothing of our\nArdasse yet. I am holding it at 15s and it would have sold readily if Persian had not arrived\nhere who brought a good quantity overland through Poland and ruined the market. One\nmust have patience. As I told you, ours are too coarse and stringy. In future, obtain\nsomething better, I shall regulate myself according to the way things go in [England] and if I\ndiscover anything good or likely to succeed will let you know.\n\nI am glad that Mr Martens Ecking has taken the \u00a320 remitted and placed it to my account.\nIt can serve towards the commissioned cotton. With this letter I am remitting you for that\naccount \u00a350 at double usance on John Banks negotiated here with Jan & Herman Luys at\n34s 4g. Please procure what is necessary for the enclosed first copy of the bill of exchange and\ncredit my account with \u00a385 16s 8d.\n\nI was glad to hear that you are not involved in the recent bankruptcy here and hope you\nare likewise free of those which have since followed, as I am, God be thanked! May He\nprotect us from wicked men. I shall be glad to hear more of what is to be hoped for from\n[England] regarding peace and war, and also if there are any changes in commodities taking\nplace. There is little worth mentioning here, partly because of the many bankruptcies and\nscarcity of money. Apulian oil costs RD 92 per 820 lb. for cash; currants are 30 to 31 ML per\n100 lb. with 8} per cent rebate, since a quantity has arrived here from [England]. Barbary\nalmonds are at 32 ML per 100 lb., Aleppo galls at 45 to 48 ML, brown ginger 44 to 42 g per\nlb., and scraped ginger at 9 or 93g with 83 per cent rebate. Of Swedish copper-wire there are\nonly about 250 coils here. Most of it is \u2018Great Crown\u2019 and the residue \u2018Crowned N\u2019 and it\ncannot be had for less than 70 to 693 ML per 100 lb. Hamburg copper-wire is at 71 to 72 ML,\nwhile copper kettles are at RD 70, sheet copper at RD 68 to 69, Swedish garcopper RD 644 to\n65 and Hungarian plates RD 60 to 61 per shippound. If there is anything in which I can be of\nservice please inform me and command.\n\nB. Sirps has been here and as far as I understand has not yet returned to [England]. If he\narrives in [London] you will know how to demand the letter-postage from him, as already\nrequested. I shall expect my current account and hope to hear how much I am to get for the rebate of duty on our Ardasse, so that I can make a record of it all. Meanwhile, with cordial\nregards, &c,",

    "TEXT": "Your welcome letter of the 5th past reached me on the 21st instant. The following will serve\nas a reply.\n\nIt is true that, because of the great quantities, wine will not sell here in the least. There is\nenough lying here to last for two years, and it is in so many hands that one cannot undercut\nprices without selling at a great loss. To tell you the truth, there is never any profit which an\nisolated individual can make here for there are too many old-established wine merchants who\nobtain the wine on their own account and drive no other trade. These people have all the tap-\nhouses under their thumbs so itis quite impossible for anyone to compete against them except\nwith loss to his colleagues. Also there is no truth in the idea that one can send it for an\nimmediate sale, much less procure remittances, because this is a commodity which is sold on\nlong-term credit. Thus, I could not give your friends full satisfaction, but if I can be of service\nto you or your friends with any other commodity you may freely command me. I would be\ngrateful for your recommendation, and you may be assured that your friends will be\ncompletely satisfied, for I shall take care of their interests as if they were my own.\n\nThe brandy will all be sold, some for 300 and some for 280 dollars per hogshead, according\nto what Mr Cletcher tells me about that which he has taken back since his return from the\ncountry. But of the other, little or none is sold, and according to what Mr Cletcher tells me he\nis on the point of selling to one of the wine dealers. I cannot see him getting more than 140\ndollars per hogshead on average, for there is much bad stuff among them. Your friends have\nbeen very badly served by those in France. I can obtain 160 and 180 dollars per hogshead for\nthe best sort, and the longer the time it takes the more loss by leakage occurs, so that from two\nbad barrels the best one must be chosen.\n\nI am very relieved that you will be suffering no loss by the cargo since you are not\ninvolved, but I wish that those who are involved might get as much profit as possible.\n\nThe un-free toll and expenses are too great. May God transfer their loss to someone else!\nYou will be further informed about what happens regarding the sale. For your report about\nwhat is happening in trade I thank you\u2014it may come in useful. It is very obvious that our\ngoods this year in England will cost [\u2014missing\u2014]. Ordinary iron is selling for 26 and 27\ndollars; fine iron at 28, 29 and 30 dollars of the sort which was previously selling for 33\ndollars, but this decline has come about because there is no shipping-freight available for\n[England] or Holland, and many goods are lying about. Garcopper costs 244 dollars, and wire\n336 to 340 dollars per shippound. Salt is now put out of the market and the first [to arrive] has\nbeen sold by me for 134 dollars per ton, and that is for two ships\u2019 lading, for your\ninformation. Just how things will develop in the spring time will tell, and you will be\ninformed.\n\nYou complain about the \u00d6sterby and Gimo iron, that it is not as good as it used to be, yet\nthat ought not to be so for I can think of no change which has taken place. Please let me know\nat once, exactly, what it is about which you are complaining. Winter is now close on our heels, so the waters are beginning to freeze. Wherewith I remain, &c.",

As I have been selling my products here at home there has been no material\non which to keep up our correspondence. However, this letter is occasioned by the fact that\nCommerce Councillor Nicholas Preus is going to London from Gothenburg with a certain\nroyal commission, and I have asked him asa friend to settle the account concerning the blank\nfarthings which was in Mr Burkin\u2019s hands. I understand he has died and I want to recover the\nremaining effects, which I transferred some time ago to Jeremias van Racy in Amsterdam.\nSince I understand that Van Raey has employed you before in his affairs I am sure that you are\nwell-informed about the matter, so I am asking you as a friend to supply Mr Preus with all the\ninformation you may have and give him good advice about how this task may be handled\nwith the greatest circumspection.\n\nFor this, it is necessary to know:\n\n1. Who is now managing the estate of the late Mr Burkin and what do you know about such\nperson?\n\n2. In what relationship does the family of Burkin stand with the Controller of the Mint, Sir\nJames Hoare?\n\n3. If the copper farthings are still in use, and if new farthings were minted for 1675, '76 and\n77?\n\n4. If the remaining 182 barrels of farthings are still in the hands of the Burkin family, or\nwhether they have been delivered to the Mint?\n\n5. Whether, of the whole consigment of 326 barrels,(2) only 144 were paid out of the Mint, or\nwhether perhaps Mr Burkin retained them all in his hands and kept a running account with\nthe Mint?\n\nAbout this and anything more which may serve to illuminate the task of Mr Preus, please\ninquire closely and let him know. I shall be most greatly obliged to re-pay you with\ngratitude, friendship and service for any assistance you may be able to give me.\n\nThe reason why I began to get involved in this trade was to help my brother Abraham\nCronstr\u00f6m, in so far that the deliveries might be completed according to contract, and it was\nmy intention to give the commission to your dear wife, Madame Marescoe. But my brother\nwarned me off, saying that the firm was not reliable but on the contrary suffered from great\ninternal jealousies and that nothing but quarrels would ensue since Burkin had been promised\nby the contract that he would have an exclusive commission; and if it came into other hands it\nwould be regarded as raw copper yet pay duty as if it were manufactured copper\u2014as it\nmostly did afterwards.\n\nI shall expect a regular report about what happens in this and other aspects of Swedish\ntrade, especially in what ways one can get coal to Stockholm at the best possible price. I\nshould also be glad to know the price of malt and hops in England, for my guidance, with\ninformation about how English malt compares with that of Danzig or Riga.\n\nWith regards, I remain, &c.",

    "TEXT": "My last letter was on the 4th of March in which I sent you a bill of exchange for \u00a3200 sterling\ndrawn on John Croger so that you could get it accepted and return it, which I am accordingly\nwaiting for. Since then I have received both your letters of the 19th and 22nd of February, to\nwhich I must say that I am very sorry you have refused to accept my drafts. This is the first\ntime that has been done to me. It might be the case that they were drawn payable to a good\nfriend of mine and were only done pro forma, but while the first is true the second is quite the\ncontrary. You should know perfectly well that when I draw a bill of exchange which affects\nthe honour of a merchant I am careful that I do not over-draw, for I am aware that any one\nwho accepts bills without the security of effects is giving me credit, and if he is not inclined to\ndo it he will not pass them. Therefore I have to know that he has sufficient effects, which on\nthis occasion I have done. But, from the beginning, I have noticed that you have had no\ninclination to accept anything unless it was covered by effects which you have not sold so I\nhave not asked, thinking that with God\u2019s help I might avoid having to do so. But with my\neffects sold at a fixed price to reliable customers, as you have done, no one can claim that I\nhave been served in conformity with the original proposal on which I began to correspond\nwith you. I am more astonished that you have not been willing to honour my drafts than you\nare astonished that I drew them! After all, to accept drafts and pay them as money comes in\nfrom the sale of goods does not require one to venture any capital. And one is getting a\nhandsome commission. People without capital can easily do that. If one wants more, one\nmust stipulate better conditions. I must declare that I am heartily annoyed that you have done\nsuch dishonour to my drafts, all the more as I know you were not lacking sufficient means to\nfulfil them. It never occurred to me, with regard to you personally, that you would not be\nsufficiently confident about the reliability of your customers to give me credit for my effects\nand that I would thus come to suffer some loss. So far, God be praised, I have found no reason\nto complain about my correspondents and it would depress me to find the first grounds with\nyou\u2014God forbid! Now patience.\n\nI shall expect a sale account and current account from you, which you will please send by\nthe next post so that I can see how we stand with one another. I can make calculations about it\nmyself since nothing is forthcoming on my latest drafts. If the consignment which went to\nBristol has been paid for please remit me the proceeds in good bills payable at sight, for you\nhave already deducted your commission.\n\nSince I see that the English are demanding \u00a34 sterling for freight on a last of tar from\nStockholm, and will not sail for less, please do no more about it. I shall arrange for everything\nto come here first, which I can have done for f.18 per last at the most; and I can get it carried\nfrom here to [London] for 18 or 20 schellings per last, so my freight will not amount to more\nthan \u00a33. And by that means I hope to demonstrate to you that you will have no reason to\ncomplain about having to advance money on my behalf, and I shall no longer have to live in\nfear of insults to my drafts.\n\nMay God give us a peace, to whose protection I commend you and remain, &c.",

    "TEXT": "I have been away from home for the last eight weeks attending the Riksdag on behalf of the\nStockholm burghers. The Riksdag was held recently in Helmstadt and because I learned that\nthere was an English ship lying at Gothenburg whose captain was thinking of returning to\nEngland I decided that I would go over to England aboard this ship. But then I got news from\nStockholm that my wife is very unwell and thus I have to cancel my journey and travel from\nhere to Stockholm, which is the cause of this letter and my request that, as a friend, you will\nbuy me the goods set out in the memorandum below and send them to me in the first\navailable ship on the same conditions on which I sent you goods last summer through Mr\nPiltarffand subsequently wrote to you about\u2014namely, that you will buy the goods and ship\nthem in your own name and deliver them to me in the river or waters of Stockholm. Mr\nPilcarff has already informed you, as you may remember, of the same conditions on which\nyou sent goods to Oloff & Nicholas T\u00f6rne last summer.\n\nI am sending you enclosed herewith four first bills of exchange drawn on Samuel van\nBreda, to pay RD 1.400 in Amsterdam and RD 600 bank-money in Amsterdam, which RD\n2.000 you will get paid, place to account and employ as instructed. The goods which I am\nlikewise shipping with this Captain Hiel are 300 pieces of copper money plates, which are\ngoing under the name of John Harwitz! who serves James Leyell and Callender. He has been\nhere and is sending the plates to his father and has written to inform him that I shall be\nreceiving these 300 pieces of plate from him. But since I cannot come over I beg you to\nreceive the 300 plates from Harwy, pay his expenses and then sell them. Place the proceeds to\nmy account and employ them as instructed. In themselves the proceeds will be too little for\nthe proposed purchases, but with the first ships leaving Stockholm this spring you will\nreceive 60 slb of copper-wire, which are already lying ready at Stockholm. I had thought of\nsending them last autumn but had no opportunity. In addition I have another so slb at the\nworks in Norrk\u00f6ping which I shall get as soon as the waters are open, all of which I shall send\nto you. I shall make good anything more you disburse on my behalf at the rate of 1/2 per cent\nper month interest until you have the payment for my goods in your hands, in accordance\nwith the terms of the contract which I sent over last summer through Mr Piltarff. I also hope\nthat the remainder of the money due has now come in. As I said in the last letter I sent over \u2014\nanother time you must not sell to people who do not pay up promptly. Furthermore, I beg\nyou on receipt of this to serve me well with good quality wares at reasonable prices.

I shall be glad if you would\nshare with me anything more you may learn about them. In my opinion, Sweden will be\nadequately supplied from here this year, and if more comes from England matters will be\nworse than they were last year. But if there is a war, England will be needing the salt itself.\n\nYour iron prices will have to be higher if one is going to bring it from Stockholm. And the\nfreight charges will have to be lower, which is likely to be the case if all the salt ships arrive\nthere and push down the rates. According to my calculations \u00a316 will scarcely be enough\nwith these freight and exchange rates.\n\nI shall expect an account of the iron, and with it a report on how much pan-iron from that\nworks you are going to keep in your hands.\n\nThe wine ought not to be going straight to Stockholm where it is now so cheap that it\nwould be better if it came directly here. However, it is best that you sell it and close the\naccount, and if these damaging exchange rates continue for a while I would prefer to have my\nmoney received there, unless arrangements can be made for investing it in something else. Let\nme know at once how things stand so that I can write and tell you to whom the money\nshould be given at Stockholm.\n\nI shall expect to get an account of the 56 slb of wire which still remains unsold, together\nwith an account of the wine.\nIn Sweden they have had a bad winter, so many works have been poorly supplied and\nalthough they believed that iron would casily maintain its price there is at the moment not\nmuch demand here. I shall be glad to learn your opinion about it in [England].\n\nSome French goods are still not prohibited here. We still hope for a peace, but if it should\nbe delayed it might well happen that England will go to war with France and then we might\ndecide on a general prohibition also. But that would be to embargo oneself, since no ships\nwould be able to sail and no one would be free, and one would know all too easily if anything\ncame from France. Je suis de vos avis touchant la gerre. Si vous en pouvez apprend quelque\nchose par M. Leyonberg en avance vous m\u2019obiligerez. The Riksdag in Sweden has ended\nwell, with money and men supplied from all sides. Si je ne me trompe cette ann\u00e9e encore\ngerre par tout et peut estre revolutions ass\u00e9 \u00e9trange. Then one will have to begin to make\npeace, commencent de I\u2019un ou de !\u2019autre bout, car le generale cannot.\n\nI remain, &c.\n\n[P.S.] [hope this week to clear up the business with Clignet and am sending over to you an\nexpress so that it can go from you to Dublin.

    "TEXT": "\u2018Sir, I have now before me yours of the 15th April noteing you had received your proportion\nof what I remited Sir John by Wood. I have since sent you 1.000 barrs more by Pooke and\nForeland, who I hope are by this time neer home. Of Helman and Roaches arryval I have\nacquainted you. Your callicoes by them shal be disposed of for your most advantage as also\nthose Sir John hath now loaden in Martin and Wood, God sending them safe. The account of\nyour former narrow bafts and long cloth I hope to send you speedily, which wil render\nreasonable wel. Of your bayes I have as yet sold only 4 bales. The rest shal be disposed of\nagainst the next ships arryve, for I perceive that commodity goes falling at home. What I can\nprinciplely recommend to you from Holland are barraganen from Valentia(1) which wil cost\nthere about 38 a 40 florins per piece. There wil be shipping from Holland comeing hether\nabout 2 month hence or something more. Sir John wil get wel by his cinamont but when\nt\u2019was bought in the exchange went at 36s 6g or higher: now I hear its fallen to 34s\u2014is a great\ndifference. In case of warr shipping from Hambourgh hether wil runn great danger unless\nthey come for the Downes and thence with English or Dutch convoy. Hetherto our English\nshipping have bin inployed in that trade but ifa breach follow with France it wil meet with a\ngreat obstruction. Then waxx may rise here and I beleive fall at Hambourgh. It must be that\nwith 3 seales, whereof I observe Mr Boverie sends considerable parcels from London. The\nfreight from Hambourgh to London is but little and from London hether very reasonable.\nWhat comes directly from Hambro wil cost more freight and if the custome in England be\n but little that may henceforward be the best way to bring it hether. I shall endeavour speedilyto cleer Mr Hayes\u2019 account, and is all at present from, Sir, your humble servant.\n\n[P.S.] I have lately bought at San Sebastian about 350 quintals of whal fins for Sir John,\nwhereof all but 100 are gonne and these roo are loaden there which I expect [hole] first good\nweather about.

One is living here almost as if one were bound hand and foot, and the\niron, garcopper and copper-wire which comes to market here is mostly sold to strangers.\nThere can only be one person in a hundred who is currently exporting on his own account,\nand when anything does get done it is in the name of someone overseas, which still carries its\ndangers. Apart from that, we are living in great ignorance about what is happening abroad\nsince our correspondence has been taken away and it can easily be three months before one\ncan get any answer from Holland and [England]. This creates uncertainty, so that it is nearly\nimpossible to get anything insured, and when correspondence is removed in such a way the\ninsurers are not happy to venture without taking a high premium, which is enough to\nsmother any profits which the owner should have enjoyed. And if the ship should on its way\nsuffer any mishap in these circumstances the insurers are very evasive, so that one has to write\noff half one\u2019s capital. But for you in [England], who have a punctual correspondence from all\nplaces, it is much easier to arrange anything for your own account.\n\nGarcopper is presently very cheap here, at 235 to 236 dollars, and it may well fall to 230\ndollars. Fine iron, serviceable for London, is at 30 or 32 dollars, medium quality at 27 to 28\nand coarse anchor iron at 25 to 26 dollars. Copper-wire is at 270 to 280 dollars.\n\nSo, if you want to arrange for something to come on your account, please keep me in mind\nand be assured that you will be as well served by me as by any others in Stockholm.\nMeanwhile, people are in good hopes of peace and trust that it will not come to a rupture\nbetween England and France. This would be the best for the whole of Christendom, and I\ntrust also that all the princes who are engaged in this war will feel it too and already have their\nshare of weariness.\n\nWherewith I commend you to the loving protection of God, and remain, &c.",

Likewise, something could be done with voyage iron\nbut in these troubled times it is best that it remains at home. I shall set them to work on it.\n\nSimilarly, one ought to be able to agree with the Tar Company for 1.200 to 1.500 lasts of\ntar and 300 to 400 lasts of pitch yearly, as you mentioned, but during this war I do not believe\nthe English here will allow it, unless it could be arranged in [London] under the pretext that\nHis Majesty the King of Great Britain wants to be assured of having such a yearly quantity in\nthe country and, accordingly, His Majesty has agreed with you (or someone else) to procure\nsuch a quantity and consequently forbidden (or, at least, will not permit) anyone else to bring\nin such commodities unless you (or whoever it is in whose name it is done) shall permit it and\nunless he charters it or orders it through you. That could turn out well, and if you would like\nto take a half share I would do my best here and you could arrange your half in [London].\nAnd with the ships that fetch the goods we could send other commodities of one kind or\nanother on which something could be gained in [England], and now is the right time to be\nthinking about it, for when we have peace there will be many standing ready to do so. Thus,\nif you have any inclination to take part, I beg you to let me know at once and I will see what is\npossible to arrange here.\nLacking the account of the plates which you have sold I shall be glad to learn how much\nthey rendered, for my guidance.\n\nAt the earliest opportunity please send me six good watches and chains that work\ncorrectly, of the kind which you bought for Mr Hedenstr\u00f6m, since I have been asked for\nthem by good friends.\n\nBless you, and with heartiest regards I remain, &c.",

Although I have been\nsuperintending for the last two nights the captain has only delivered 193 sacks and I shall not\npay him his freight until all the rest are received.\n\nSince then I have sold 150 sacks, namely roo to Mr De Heusch and 50 to Adrian Justus at\n3 3/4g with 8 2/3 per cent rebate for payment in bank money. They will collect them in the\nmorning and I shall try to sell the rest so that I can send you the account. In my last letter I\nordered another 100 sacks of brown ginger to be bought at 15s or below, and if you are\ninterested in going halves let us take 200 sacks. This I now confirm. You know what sort of\nquality to obtain. What I have here is good, and the freight is very reasonable, which will\nmake it easier to have a coarser quality. It will be useful for your guidance to know that if the\nsacks are rather bigger the expenses here can be better managed, for one has to pay just as\nmuch tare, brokerage and other expenses if the sack is of 100, 120, or 80 lb., so if the quality is\ngood the bigger sacks are to be preferred.\n\nI hope you have performed my commission for white, scraped ginger. Regarding\nBermuda tobacco, as I said before, please do not pay more than sd, and for good Barbados\nsugar do not give more than 21s 6d to 22s, buying 10 butts for my account or 20 butts for us\nin partnership. And it may be useful for your guidance to know that one makes the most loss\nby the tare on the heaviest butts, for here the tare is 14 per cent while in [England] it isas much\nfor a heavy as for a light butt. Such Barbados sugar as has arrived here is selling for 5 3/4 \u2014 7/8g on\naverage, with 8 2/3 per cent rebate. Because a rupture is still foreseen please take care that what\nyou send to me is loaded in ships which are going with convoy. It would be very unwise to\nload it in German ships sailing with French passes for I fear the English will not suffer it. I\nhope you know how to guard against that.\n\nI have been told today that Nath. Mathew has absented himself from the Exchange and as\na result I fear his father in London may follow him. I long to know that the \u00a3100 drawn on\nhim, falling due on the 24th instant and remitted to you on the 5th, has been settled.\nMeanwhile, with cordial regards, I remain, &c.",

Those most wanted here are the blackest or the\nbiggest kind, but no small ones. Furthermore, we see that you say that those from Biscay\nweigh from 4, 43 to 5 lb., per piece, so they must be nearly all of the same size, and they\nwould sell for 16s[oldi] per lb., more or less, according to quality. The white ones should be\nthrown out, otherwise they cause offence here. The black and dried ones will all sell as there\nare none in town apart from those in our hands, for your information. Dutch fins are also\nfrom 3, 3+ to 34 lb., and 100 ]b. Dutch-weight amounts to 150 lb. here for wares which do not\nperish, such as lead, iron, pepper, or the like, and whale-fins of one type always spoil more\nthan the other since they are shipped moist.\n\nA piece-of-cight is worth \u00a35, or 100 s/oldi]. Charges on fins, pepper, lead as well as many\nother goods are few since they are mostly sought after duty-free and only have to be stored.\nConcerning warchouse rent, it is ordinarily (though contrariwise for all cloths, bays, says,\nlinens) a duty charged on the seller of 1 per cent ona valuation of the goods, though the prices\nhave been once again raised. Pepper sells at present for 105 soldi per lb., great lead at \u00a3164 per cantar which is the same as 100 lb. Dutch or 150 lb. of theirs.

For your instruction, it is not advisable that we should sell anything at present but rather\nlet the others undercut each other. Our time will come. As already mentioned, I shall not be\narranging for any more ships to go to [England] this year. In 1676, over 3,000 lasts of tar and\n600 lasts of pitch were sent to England, which were altogether consumed before any of mine\narrived, but this year, besides my total, less than a quarter as much will be shipped.\n\nConcerning what you propose about the conditions on which I can draw \u00a34 per last on tar\nand \u00a36 per last on pitch at the arrival of the ships: for the reasons you allege I shall draw no\nmore than \u00a34 per last on the tar until it is sold, but once sold I may (if I need to) always draw\nthe surplus on each ship\u2019s lading without waiting for the money to come in. And on the pitch,\nsince each last of pitch costs me twice as much as the tar, I would gladly see you allow me to\ndraw \u00a38 per last, which is not unreasonable. As for bad debts, I shall guarantee you, and\nlikewise against the risk of fire (which God forbid!) but I cannot agree to allow you to sell to\nothers than the previously specified tar-buyers, since you judge the danger of bad debts to be\nso great.\n\nYou request that I should reimburse your outlay if you need it: I am always quite willing\nto reimburse you within two months of being informed by delivering over to you such\neffects as will suffice but on the condition that you only charge 4 per cent commission on their\naccount. On these conditions, and provided that you always follow my orders about selling,\nwe can again continue to deal with one another.\n\nOn these conditions I have today drawn, payable to Joseph Deutz\u2019s order:\n\nwhich bills of exchange I send herewith for acceptance.

Avec tout cella, la paix n\u2019a pas este\nencore ratiffie par les Estats, mais on la tient pourtant imancable, voire mesme qu'elle sera\ngeneralle, non obstant les grands apprets que vostre estat continue de faire pour la Flandre.\nDieu nous donne ce qu\u2019il voit mieux que nous nous estre necessaire en achevant. A prezante\nnous venons de vandre encore 200 torches de fil de latton a ung de nos ouvriers de dehors a\n\u00a385t.

Il n'y a que ce qui\ns\u2019attend encore que nous embarrasse car cette marchandize tombant d\u2019ordinaire en plusieurs\nmains le prix est fort difficille a se maintenir.

Nous voudrions bien en leur consideration et en\nla vostre pouvoir vous rendre quelque service qui vous fust agreable. Pour satisfaire a ce que\nvous nous demandez nous vous dirons, qu\u2019il est vray que Mons. Hersemitte comme I\u2019un des\ndirecteurs en cette ville de la Compagnie du Nort recevoit les marchandises que en venoient\npour le compte de la ditte Compagnie, laquelle avoit des previlesges qui consistoient en ce\nqu\u2019ils payoient moins de drois que les particuliers, mais cette Compagnie est a present comme\nestinte. Nous ne scavons sy a present que la paix sera faitte ils reprendrons en quelque facon ce\ncommerce, mais nous voyons qu'il y a desja long temps qu\u2019on travaillea la liquidation. Ils ont\nvandus tous leurs navires et tout ce qu\u2019ils avoient de matteriaux et chose propre pour la\nconstruction, ainsy nous croyons qu\u2019il ne viendra plus de marchandises pour ce compte-la. La\nprincipale consommation du bre, gouildron et chanvre est ce qu il en faut pour les magazins\nde Rochefort, dont les achapts ce font publiquement pour toutes les choses dont l\u2019on a besoing\npour les magazins, et presentment ils sont assignes pour la douze et quinze de ce mois. On\nachepte la a livrer de celuy quy fait le meilleur marche, et mesme le Roy fournit a l\u2019advance\nune partie du payement.

Il faut toujours du gouildron, comme aussy des cuivres en platte; cela vient\nordinairement d\u2019Hollande mais nous estimons qu\u2019on les peut tirer a meilleur march\u00e9\nd\u2019Angleterre.

We here live in\nhopes of peace, but what pertains to trade\u2014which is now mostly carried on by the English\u2014\nis bad.

So this will serve as a friendly comment on\nthe 3 packs of goods from Hull, which I received as per invoice. I was well-satisfied with the\ngoods, but I do not know where the \u00a35 6s 4d comes from since W. Skinner brings\n\u00a316 12s 3d into his account for expenses at Hull.\n\nBut, my dear Mr David, I have something to say about the 14 packs from London! Some\nof the wares are good, and some of them are bad, though I found the total number correct\naccording to the invoice. The pack No. 1 with 30 pieces of northern kerseys was so bad that I\ncannot describe it. You put them down at 17d to 18d and 109d, but if you offered me such\ntattered goods for 10d I would not have them! They are not half as good as cottons, and are\nnothing else but trash. So, likewise, are most of the dozens. I have never seen such wretched\ngoods. You must have bought the dozens and kerseys from a Quaker[?].(1) He has put two\npieces together, but he must have been a scoundrel who sold you the 30 pieces of kersey and\n40 dozens. He has deceived you like a fool. You know that I ordered you to buy the dozens\nand kerseys in Hull and not in London, and to have three kersey pieces wrapped in one but\nnot two dozens in one. In London one can get no good dozens, only old, wretched things\nwhich seem at first like boards and full of worms, and the inside piece is so awful that I am\nashamed to look at it. You have charged me for them at 3s 8d, 4s and 4s 6d and so on, but\nthey are not worth 2s on average. They are nothing but rubbish.\n\nHowever, the cottons and the bays and silk camisoles are good. I note that you put 3 pieces\nof bays wrapped up in one, but that is not what I ordered. I wanted each piece on its own, and\nthe camisoles among the yellow bays, some in each piece. I was soon able to dispose of them.\nThe three pieces of bays were very heavy and not very well sewn together with strong thread\nor sail-yarn. In packs 9, 10 and 11 were serges, with which I was also well satisfied, as much\nwith the goods as the packing with three pieces wrapped in one. In pack 12 I was also well\npleased with the coloured cloths, and in packs Nos. 13 and 14 I was content with the pieces,\nalthough the colours do not match well with each other. All in all, I am well satisfied with\nthem except with the wretched 40 dozens and 30 pieces of kerseys. You must not buy such commodities in London another time. This is friendly advice to you, with which I commend\nyou to God\u2019s protection.\n\n[P.S.] The 30 pieces of kersey from Hull were not laid, three pieces in one, according to my\norders, instead of each piece on its own. Another time, strict attention must be given to\nfollowing orders.\nN.B. On closing this letter I received yours of the 6th of August under Mr Pincier\u2019s cover,\nfrom which I see that you have ordered some goods from Hull. In reply, I must say that I\nwould rather not have had them because I will not receive them at the right time. I have\nalready supplied myself with as many dozens and kerscys as I can sell over the winter. I have\njust seen that the captain has arrived from Hull, but he has no account with him, only the bill\nof lading and a small freight bill. Farewell.",

    "TEXT": "Your letter of the 8th instant has reached me safely, from which I see that the copper plates I\nsent aboard Captain Blauwers have been sold to two people who will pay in two and four\nmonths time. I had hoped you would sell to the Guinea Company, or to someone else, for\ncash payment as you always assured me you would in your letters. I would have been much\nhappier to see you had done so, but since you have done otherwise there is no point in\nchanging it. I hope these people are doubly reliable, otherwise I wish you had rather left my\ngoods unsold and waited for a cash-customer. I must content myself with the thought that\nthe transaction will have been a good one if the people turn out to be good.\n\nYou write of '\u00a35 4s at 4 months\u2019 and \u2018\u00a35 2s at 2 months\u2019. This must be an error, and\nshould be \u00a36, otherwise I would be doing badly and could not approve of the sale. I have\nseen in other letters from [London] that such plates can fetch \u00a36 4s for cash. Furthermore, I\nhope you will be satisfied in both cases with 2 per cent commission so that I can enjoy some\nprofit thereby. This will give me some motive for continuing, otherwise I shall have to\nsuspend the trade. Sheet copper at \u00a36 ros is a bad price\u2014with that one can expect no profit\nbut only loss. When, at the existing rate of exchange, one can make \u00a37 sterling I shall send\nsome more. Because I have my own mill I can provide you with a quantity of sheet-copper\nplates and pots at a fixed price, when I know what assortment sells. Only I would rather trade\nfor payment in cash and would only grant two to three months credit when I can stipulate a\ngood price from reliable people.\n\nLikewise, I shall also send black latten and white when you can give mea fixed price which\nyou will stand by. It is a commodity which is in demand in [London].\n\nI thank you for honouring my draft of \u00a3150 sterling, because the rate of exchange was\nsuch that it might have been refused. In order to enjoy this rate again I am taking the liberty\nof drawing another \u00a3100 sterling, not doubting that you will honour it with due acceptance.\n\nI have loaded 50 pieces of plate in Leonard Bushell for my account, marked 'L'. He will\nbe ready to sail in a few days time. With my next letter a bill of lading will follow. I cannot agree with Captain Meerwich, who has already departed, about the freight. I rely on you to\ntreat me like a friend in the matter, and commend you to God\u2019s protection, &c.",

Since then I have received yours of the 8th instant.\nI have received the galls from Cutler, but I have to tell you (although to my regret, for I\n\ngreatly dislike complaining) that I am astonished you should send me such goods. Ten or\n\ntwelve of the sacks are passable, although I had hoped for better, but the rest are so extremely\nbad that I have never had the like in twenty years of trading. It is bad, uncultivated stuff,\nmostly of bush-galls. If one takes them out of the sack with a ladle[?] or dish(1) there are no\nblue galls to be seen underneath but only wild galls. What can I say? It is annoying to be\nserved in such a way. One pays over good money for it yet is obeyed in nothing even though\nI gave such explicit orders and asked you to send only good, plump, blue galls or else nothing\nat all, and not to quibble about 6d or 1s more. I do not know how to sell such terrible stuff\nhere, much less can I send it to my friends. I would lose their commissions. I would like to\nknow, what am I to do with these awful galls? If you do not believe me you can tell Mr\nRuland or Mr Lethieullier so that they can see them and give you better advice. As I do not\nseek your harm, I would rather that you did not desire mine. I am heartily sorry that I have to\npress this. I still need 6 or 8 sacks of choice quality galls, and to my great annoyance I must buy them from others, which is very painful.

All the goods which we order from Holland\u2014not only those wares\nwhich are sent on credit, but also those which our factor buys for us for cash\u2014are sent\ndirectly to us and we are aware of no other expenses apart from those which are customary in\nHolland.

They would not cost as much as they do on\nsuch conditions as you have stipulated for us in the account. Things are very different now\nfrom what they were before, with Mr Darbey. Then the English were sole masters and we\nhad to allow them to do as they liked, but now things are different. If you will not treat us\nreasonably it will oblige us to do business with someone else. Last year Mr William Cooper\nsent us some goods but was aware of nothing more than ordinary charges. You can take it\nfrom this that we will not stand for it, or pay for it. We recently sent you wire, which reached\nyou unhindered; why then cannot our goods come unmolested?\n\nIf you will serve us as a factor and provide us with good insurers every time we will do\nfurther business together and order larger amounts than ever before. But if not, we shall have\nto find another who will serve us in return for his commission.\n\nYou will send us our account by way of Livland and compile a proper expense account so that we can settle this consignment with one another.

    "TEXT": "My last letter to you was on the 24th of December. Since then I find myself with your\nwelcome letters of the 6th, 13th, 20th of December and 3rd instant, and have seen thereby\nthat you had not yet received the Barbary almonds which you bought for me, and that you\nwere of the opinion that you ought to delay their receipt for as long as possible. I am glad of\nthat since we will not be having open water very soon and in the meantime the almonds\nwould suffer rather from the rats, like those on a ship from Barbary which delivered its cargo\nsomewhat damaged. And I note that in this way we may get them cheaper, but I beg you\nplease make sure that you receive nothing but good quality, for bad quality goods are no use\nto me at any price. Please keep yourself informed if newly arrived goods are sold at lower\nprices.\n\nI am glad that the \u00a385 remitted for your account was accepted. I have received the protest\nconcerning the \u00a3100 on B. Sirps and will know what to do with it. Concerning the \u00a3100\nwhich you have paid for the honour of Lubers, I have debited you for \u00a3100 18s 4d. I could\nhave wished that you had returned the bill of exchange together with the second protest, but\nas you have not done so by now it should not be necessary for us to correspond about it again,\nand I believe that in future this Lubers will behave himself with more discretion than he has\nshown towards me.\n\nI have sold your Jamaican tobacco to Hans. P. Dimpfel at 42s per lb., for cash, payable in\nbank money. Please make a note of it. With my next letter I shall send you an account. I could\nnot push the price up any higher, and I would rather have taken 1/8s less in bank money than\nsell it for current money, for the agio on it is 34 per cent and there is uncertainty whether it\nmight not go higher. I have also sold 48 sacks of our scraped ginger which came with\nHendrick Weever and delivered them yesterday to Hermann Harvart for 7 1/8g with 8 2/3 rebate\npayable in bank money. The price is rather poor and we shall not gain much by it, but as there\nis so little demand for it now I did not want to let the opportunity pass. The account of this\nalso will be sent by my next, and if the money has come in a remittance will be made to you.\nMeanwhile I think we shall also get in the money for our last bale of Ardasse because the\ndebtor has promised it. As for our Bermuda tobacco, with the waters closed I can still find no\nbuyers, but if any opportunity offers itself it will not be neglected. I wait to hear if any nice\nVirginia-leaf can be had in [England] and at what price and when the ships are expected. I\nshall inquire how the purchaser fares with your tobacco and keep you informed. As far as I\ncan discover he sends it into Germany in place of another variety.\n\nI see that you have been persuaded to believe that one cannot learn any good German here\nand as a result have requested your servant! to be sent to some place in Germany where he can\nbetter perfect the language. I would gladly see to that if did not believe that it would not be\nprofitable either for you or your servant, for you ought to consider the fact that he will not\nlearn to pronounce the language like a born-German within five years and will be little use to\nyou unless he can write the language correctly, which is what you want him mostly to do,\nand he can just as well learn to write here as in Germany, for there is no difference; and he is\nalready so far advanced that he can read and understand any book in High German just as\nwell, if not better, than Dutch and also speaks High German, so it only remains for him to\nlearn the style of German letters, which cannot be easily done except in a counting-house. I\nhope to help him find one, and expect to hear from houses in N\u00fcremberg.

The best that we have been able to\ncontrive is to arrange for him to go on managing his works and to supply him with a quantity\nof copper which, in exchange, he returns back again as manufactured brass. The wages for it\nare deducted from his debt and although this will take a very long time (and also cannot be\ndone without employing a good deal of money) we have decided it is better to deal with it on\nthis basis than to let the debt run on still longer. But we believe there is still nothing that can\nbe done for you as long as you have not settled accounts with Momma and got him to\nacknowledge the debt, which will only be obtained with difficulty, for according to our\nobservation he will stir up some dispute. In his letter of January the 3rd, which we received\nyesterday, he complains much that his goods remain for so long unsold in London, being\nastonished that his kettles and pots have not been sent to us to sell in accordance with the\norders which he gave to you last summer, since the proceeds would be made good to you.\nHaving got no answer about this he asks us to write to you to find what reason there is for\ndelay, to which we await your decision. And in case you feel some difficulty, for fear that we\nshall make our claims on it, we hope it will not inhibit you, assuring you that if they can be\nsold here the proceeds will be sent to you. With regard to our kettles and pots, we have\nhitherto not restricted you to any price limit and once again we beg you to make an end of the matter the sooner the better so that the account can be closed.

And as I had\nobserved in what good esteem you were held by the aforementioned gentlemen and that you\nwere practical and precise in all kinds of trade, I found no difficulty in recommending Mr\nAndreas Ingolstetter of N\u00fcremberg to address himself to you,(1) who had requested me to find\nhim a reputable and reliable correspondent who would be willing to serve him in the\npurchase of English tin. He initially wanted to know the varieties and prices of it, and at what\ncost it could be delivered to him at Bremen, so that he could see if he would find it profitable,\nand in future wants to send for any other English products suitable for Germany. If you are\nnow inclined to favour him with the raguagly(2) of tin and other wares I have no doubt that in\ndue course a mutually satisfactory correspondence can be established, especially if the good\nGod grants us a general peace. You can be assured that he is a man of complete reliability,\nprecise and accurate in his affairs, of which I can give you certain testimony as I know him\nintimately, having lived with him for many years. But in case you do not take my word for\nit, since you do not know me, he will be able to inform you of enough reliable people who\nwill be able to assure you about his condition. In any case, if you join together in a\ncorrespondence his own conduct will give you adequate testimony to his promptitude and\nreliability. It is a matter of indifference to him whether you correspond with him in Italian,\nFrench or Low German, though the Low German will be the best for him as you are not\naccustomed to writing High German.\n\nBesides Mr Ingolstetter, I have recommended your person and condition to Mr Willem\nGrassel at N\u00fcremberg,(3) who will perhaps write to you about a trial purchase of tin, in which\ncase you would do well to serve him as he is also reputed reliable and is one of the principal\npersons in the city, though he is not so intimately known to me as Mr Ingolstetter, who\nmakes no fuss about himself but goes about his business quietly and confidently. You can, if\nyou wish, write to them directly in reply when they write to you or, if you judge it necessary,\nwrite to me, giving the letters to the ordinary post to be forwarded by Mr Christian\nMeschman. As it suits him that I should come at once to London I shall seek to have the honour of waiting upon you. Meanwhile, with friendly regards, I commend you to God\u2019s\nprotection, &c.",

Sales are\nso small that prices are stifled and are as likely to produce losses as profits, as is the case with\nthose in [London] who have bought pepper from the East India Company, for it cannot be\nsold here at 12 1/2g. It is said that a quantity was sold at 12g, and that is how things are with\nother goods, as far as one can see, so that one is forced to sit tight. The higher rate of\nexchange, as you can see at the foot of this letter, also harms commodity prices. Black ginger\ncan be had at 3 1/2 to 3 5/8g; scraped ditto, 7g; Caribbean indigo of extremely choice quality, 4 3/4s\nwith 13 months rebate; Aleppo galls, 47 ML per 100 lb., as before. Whether Turkish or\nLevant wares will increase in price through the danger from the Turks, time will tell. The\nbale of Ardasse which you last provided is still lying here unsold. The English have got a\nquantity, with which they are heavily undercutting the price at 13s, with 10 2/3 per cent\ndiscount, which is reckoned to have been bought in [London] at 9s. The exchange is at 34s 5g\nand the net charge for insurance is 2 per cent. Although, as you truly say, the price is low,\nnonetheless there is no profit to be made, which is a miserable state of affairs. Of Zerbassi,\nLegi and other varieties one can buy here as cheaply as you can offer it in [London]. It is the\nmost delicate stuff that one could ever see, so wonderfully has that trade been driven. If there\nshould be any changes in silk, galls or ginger, please let me know.\n\nPlease hand the enclosed, undamaged, to Mr Samuel la Motte and procure an answer.

Oil remains\nat the same price still and is selling for RD 80 per pipe, since there is little in town. Indigo\nguatemalo is at 6s. There are few raisins to be obtained, and I refer you for the rest to the\nenclosed price-current.(1)\n\nI should be glad to know when a convoy is going from [England] to Spain.

Business in this country is still very bad, particularly\nbecause we have had a long, dry winter, which still continues. This spring we have had hardly\nany rain and the sea has been frozen from the continued cold, which means that all iron and\ncopper works have been at a standstill for lack of water. I am sure that not half as much iron\nhas been worked this year as at other times in the past. I have been waiting all spring for\n1.000-1.200 slb of iron to come down with the first barge, but so far have had no more than\n600 slb, and that is on account of the shortage of water. Although I would wish you to have\n2.000 slb it will be rather slow to go now. Likewise, I also have 100 slb of copper at Nyk\u00f6ping\nand 200 slb at Norrk\u00f6ping, which I have ordered to be made into copper-wire, but because of\nthe lack of water it is also delayed for a long time. Meanwhile, there is an English ship lying at\nNorrk\u00f6ping which will be leaving soon and I shall load on it, consigned to you, as much as is now ready.

I am doing so now because Mr\nHendrick Cletcher handed over to me on the 13th instant a letter of yours, dated the 16th of\nMay, together with a bill of exchange for RD 2.100 drawn on His Excellency Erick Fleming,\nwith orders about what to do if it were not paid. Mr Cletcher gave me the letter because he\nwas about to set off on his journey to his works, as you can see from the accompanying letter\nfrom him, to which I refer you. You can be assured that I shall serve you promptly and\nreasonably. Concerning the bill of exchange, I tried to show it to the acceptant but as he died\nsome weeks ago in the country and as his wife is still there I have had to let the widow know\nabout the bill by letter and, if she is willing to accept the same, have asked her to let one of her\nfriends write to me and assure me that the bill would be promptly paid. If the acceptant asks\nme to send the bill of exchange I cannot decide whether or not to send the original into the\ncountry, but I am keeping to the letter he wrote to me and as long as it is accepted there\nshould be no difficulty. These people want to make it good and I do not doubt that it will be\npromptly honoured as the widow wants her son to maintain his credit, of which they stand in\nneed. Herewith goes a letter to him which I beg you to forward as soon as possible. He writes\nthat he will pay me in cash. If so I shall await your orders, being at your command at any\nhour, for at the present there is no chance of remitting to London or Hamburg or Amsterdam\nat a rate of 24 dollars per \u00a31 sterling, as no one wants to do it on London for less than\n27 dollars, nor Hamburg for 26 marks and Amsterdam for 25 marks, so there is nothing to be\ndone, and I can see no prospect of improvement.\n\nIron is at 29 or 30 dollars, according to quality, and one can get good iron for 30 dollars and\nvery fine iron for 31 dollars. There is little sign ofany change. Wire is at 280 to 282 dollars and\nit is thought that it might perhaps rise higher since not so much is being made as last year.\nThere is no pitch or tar for sale as the Company itself has none here to load its own ships with,\nthough things may be better in the summer when moreis likely to come in. If you could send\na ship with malt, which now fetches 16 dollars per ton and looks very likely to fetch more by\nAugust, and take a return cargo of tar and some wire and iron, you would not do badly.\n\nWhatever your order, you can rest assured that it will be promptly attended to as soon as it\ncomes, If there are any other matters in which I can be of service you have only to command.\nI handle the affairs of Steven de Geer and David van Baerle, who assure me that they are well satisfied, and I am sure you will likewise find it so. For the present there is nothing more\nexcept friendly regards, &c.",

If the Lord\nbrings him in safety I shall take possession of the same and put them in a good place in the\nwarehouse and meanwhile await your orders, for you will have seen from my foregoing\nletter that I have left the proffered galls for your account, and there they can remain. My\nintention, when I gave the order, was to have some if there was any considerable rise in prices\nbeing maintained. You will by now have cancelled my order, and I am meanwhile waiting to\nhear what you want to have done with them, and whether you wish them to be bought by\nme. You can rest assured that your interests will be safeguarded as if they were my own, and\nthat you will find me punctual and prompt in everything, in order to encourage you to\nentrust me with further commands, I trust that the opportunity will present itself so that we\ncan have more dealings with one another. May God only grant that business will improve! At\npresent there is little demand for galls and things are rather quiet, but I hope that before long\nthings will go better. Meanwhile, the Leipzigers have come, who usually buy a good\nquantity. I have been now and again offered 47 ML per 100 lb., with 13 months rebate, for a\nquantity of mine, but I have not wanted to sell them since you persuaded me that they would\nnot decline in price. Now, others are selling good quality stuff at 46 1/2 ML per 100 lb., but I\nhope that they will pick up again as soon as there is more demand. This will be governed by\nthe quantity coming from [England], which will be known to you, and if the price is\nreasonably firm I shall either keep them or dispose of them.\n\nI see that pepper has risen in price in [London]. It remains here at 12 3/4g per lb., but may\nwell be influenced by that. I still have mine all together in hand, which at first were selling ata\nloss for 12g. Raisins have been greatly sought after. Please learn what can be expected from\n[England]. Good quality should sell in handfuls for 30 to 31 ML per 100 lb. If you can send\nany please do so freely, vizt. choice quality, if you can haggle for it at 12s per lb. Oil and many\nother Marseille goods are falling; only capers have newly arrived and are selling in handfuls at\n52 ML per 100 lb., with 13 months rebate and a 30 per cent tare.\n\nFriendly regards, the Lord protect you, &c.",

Put that down to me,\nalthough I fear that the expenses will be very great and may easily amount to 4d [per lb.], as\nthe subsequent account will probably show.

I long to hear that the \u00a350 bill of exchange has been accepted as the\ndrawer assured me it would be, and upon which I gave him the value.\n\nIconfirm my order about buying for me 25 bales of pepper, and I must now wait to hear at\nwhat price you have obtained them. You will have seen from my preceding letter that I have\npunctually honoured your bill of exchange for \u00a3200 and set against it a bill for \u00a3200 at\n34s 11g for which you have been credited with 2.618.12 ML. The said amount is remitted for\nmy account and can serve for the pepper.\n\nI have just now seen in a letter to Mr Ruland the prices which have been set by the [English\nEast India] Company on one commodity and another, I greatly wish I might have known\nthis eight days earlier so that I could have rushed off an order, since not much cardamon was\nsold. Ihad imagined that the price would have been higher, but 3s per lb. is quite reasonable.\nI wish I had commissioned it together with my preceding order, but if the Company has not\nraised it much higher than it is now, and if you can obtain it in one way or another so that it\nwill yield a little profit, I would gladly have 500 to 600 lb. I should also be glad to have ro or\n15 pots of preserved ginger, as a trial, at the least price obtainable. But please buy nothing\nother than good quality and look after my interests as if they were your own. For your\nreimbursement please draw the total on me for payment at the beginning of next month and\nyour bills will be punctually honoured. I could have remitted to you today for 35s, at sight,\nbut I find that I have already disposed of my balance and can only take in bills at the\nbeginning of next month at the earliest, on which you may rely.\n\nIf you cannot obtain fine quality ginger at 14s I shall be glad to hear by return of post since I\nshall then given an alternative order and make a remittance. I shall also be glad to learn, in\nreply to this, what prospect you see concerning the cardamon.\n\nYesterday I had a buyer for two sacks of galls [that with](2) the same took one sack of mine,\nwhich satisfied him well, so one must let him have his way. One of your sacks of galls was also\nsold to Hans Ellers for 46 1/2 ML per 100 lb. at 13 months discount, and this morning a weaver\nhas promised to come and fetch a sack. I shall dispose of them as best I can, but I wish I could\nfind just one buyer for your galls. If he would take the whole batch I would be glad to lower\nthe price. One must wait for an opportunity, and I shall allow no chance to slip by. You can\nbe assured that I shall do my duty, but one cannot always sell as one wants to here, and I\nnotice that others are unable to sell anything, or have sold anything since the Leipzigers went away.

I\nshall now wait and see how much there will be for the coming year and take care that the\nlengths of the thick bars are not uneven but trimmed off, as some have been.\n\nI now have before me your letter of July the 11th. Cletscher is not here but is expected\nsoon and we shall then discuss your affairs. Young Momma is here, telling everyone of the\nwrong you do them. The only thing I had to say is that the objections to paying were quite\nordinary ones et que j\u2019en estois autrement inform\u00e9, and that Mr Cletscher had since got\norders to see what could be done, mais je vous diray bien mon sentiment, the gentleman is so\nmuch behindhand that there is nothing to be got from him. J\u2019auray soin de vostre interest,\nmais vous ne ferez pas mall de donner vos ordres un peu amplement a Mr Cletscher if you\nwant to reach a settlement.\n\nThe exchange on Amsterdam is high here, at about 26 dollars, et fort peu de bonne lettres.\n\nThere is not much iron in stock: all the works are at a standstill for lack of water and abroad\nthere are no sales. The English come here with salt to lade tar. There is little pitch and now\nlittle tar also, but more is likely to come. Botte aura fait un movais coup. Without the pitch\nwe would have difficulty in finding the running capital, in my opinion. Mr Wouters? has\nbought for you a quantity of \u2018O\u2019 iron at 31 dollars and given 32 for 'L'. This is to make up\nfor the exchange rate. There are now four English ships here which will have difficulty in\nobtaining any freight or cargo if no tar arrives, because there is not as much iron in town as\nthey need for their lading.\n\nVoyla la pais conclus entre les Rois du Nort! I hope that matters will now go rather better.\n\nLa sell se vent a 13 1/2 dollars now, and ifan English ship had not arrived with some it would\nhave risen. There is still one more expected, et puis les vesseaux holandois are somewhat\ndelayed, it may well rise again.\n\nThere is little copper in stock. It has all been coined and stands at 290 dollars. Wire can be\ngot at 270 to 272 dollars.\n\nAbraham Cronstr\u00f6m is expected in town any day. I shall then obtain his power of attorney\nand send it, but he behaves as if evite de rencontrer Momma, for he will then be perplexed\nand not know what to say.

No one knows how the exchange goes,\naccording to Mr Jacob Fahlgreen, or whether it will continue. It is just not possible to remit\ngood bills of exchange for [London] at the moment for 25 dollars, or to Hamburg, or to\nAmsterdam. The reason is that bills on London can fetch 28 dollars, on Hamburg 26 1/4 to 1/2,\nand on Amsterdam 25 1/2 to 26 marks, so there is nothing to be done.\n\nIt is difficult to spend anything on pitch or tar. There is scarcely any pitch and little tar in\nstock, so that whoever takes it gets bad stuff for 130 dollars. I hear that it scarcely fetches \u00a37\nin [London], so that also must be passed over. As for orgronts iron, such as \u2018OO\u2019 or 'G',\nthe latter is not obtainable but I have ordered as much of the \u2018OO\u2019 as your funds here with me\nextend to for 31 dollars, which the other English here would have gladly taken but I obtained\nthe preference. \u2018G\u2019 is to be had, but not for less than 32 dollars. It is in Claes Wilkens\u2019s hands\nand he has sold it to various Englishmen at 32 dollars, so I hope you will be content with this\namount. About 200 slb will be shipped tomorrow morning with Captain William Norham,\nan Englishman, for [London]. I have agreed the freight at \u00a32, or forty shillings, per last. I\nshall consign it to you and give orders to Jan van Deurs at the Sound that he draws the Sound\ntoll on you. This serves to inform you in case you find it necessary to order some insurance.\n\nThe rest of the iron is expected from the works in eight days. I shall then ship it as quickly\nas possible and let you know when it is done. There is no square iron nor yet broad iron, but\nsome voyage iron. As soon as the bill of lading is signed it will be sent to you.\n\nYou would do well if you could send some English malt.

    "TEXT": "I have not had any of your letters for a long while, which occasions the brevity of this.\n\nBecause of the cheap freight-rates to [England] in free English shipping I have decided to\nsend you a quantity of iron for my own account, as a trial. It will consist of orgronts iron, up\nto 800 slb of ordinary plate 'G' iron, and about 450 slb of schampeleon and other sorts of\nY' iron. It has been distributed and loaded in the following three ships, each with about\nthe same amount\u2014in the ship called the Providence of London, of which Ralph Johnson is\ncaptain; in the ship Industry of London, captain Henry Collins, and also in the ship named\nJohn of Yarmouth, captain John Allen. And because they will be sailing in the autumn I dare\nnot take any risks, so I must ask you to be so kind as to have them insured against all risks by\ngood and reliable insurers, each of them for RD 2.200, which for all three ships amounts to\nRD 6.600. You need have no doubts about the shipment being made, God willing, and you\nhave only to ask Mr Urban Hall and other friends who used to live here about me to be\nsatisfactorily informed. The freight rate has been agreed at 30 shillings per last of 15\nshippounds, and in the bill of lading it has been stated that it has been shipped by me for your\naccount and risk, so will you please write accordingly to Jean van Deurs at Elsinore in order\nthat he can lay out the toll-money for you and draw it on you. If the dear Lord will give us a\nsecure peace I will send you a good quantity each year, provided that I find it worth my\nwhile. For I must be served by you on reasonable terms, in controlling the expenses and\ntaking care to whom you sell, though I cannot tie you down to any fixed price. I also hope\nyou will be satisfied with a 1 1/2 per cent commission and an allowance of 4 per cent on any\nadvance of money you may make on receipt of the bills of lading. In your reply I shall expect\nto learn how much you will permit me to draw on you from Hamburg, and please mention\nin it what your friend is called and commend to him the honour of my bills of exchange. If\nyou insist on asking for a higher rate of interest I shall have to submit to it patiently until the\ngoods are sold, although the bad prices which I am advised there are in [England] will not\nbear any high interest charges.\n\nIf there is still a lot of pitch and tar for Mr Botte\u2019s account lying on your hands unsold,\nplease keep me informed about it, because I also have some interest in it. But do not mention\nit to him or let him know that I have sent you any goods on my account. He has no share in it.\n\nThe news is that there is no tar nor pitch here in town, and the English ships lying here are\nunable to get any, which is the reason why they have to take the iron for such a cheap freight.\nOne cannot expect any tar before the month of October, but iron is fetching reasonably good prices here. With friendly regards, &c.\n\n[P.S.] If in the coming year, you would like to contract for the pitch and tar coming to\nEngland so that it can all be held in one hand I shall be glad to help you in preference to others,\nbut it is necessary that you have a capable man of English nationality living here who can\ndefend the contract for you against the resident English, and when you have a ship here he can\nrun along to the authorities and obtain permission for it to export something in one way or\nanother.

The old man is at Nyk\u00f6ping and\nthe young man is here, but there is nothing to be done with them. They are stiff-necked and\nrefuse to listen to reason. The one living here is usually drunk everyday from the morning\nonwards. Enfin, in my opinion, if one proceeds against them one will be only throwing good\nmoney after bad.\n\nI shall see if something can be arranged with Mr Cletscher about the interested parties, but\nit will not be easy. Also a salt licence will first have to be obtained. This gentleman is no\ncommission-agent and he concerns himself only with his own affairs, au reste, honnete\nhomme.\n\nI long to get your letters and my wine, which is taking a long time. Otherwise it will be\ntoo late, for we shall be in the depths of winter before the two voyages can reach the inland\nsea. At the earliest opportunity please let me know your opinion about the pan iron and how\nmuch one might have made for the coming year. I shall give orders for the rough ends to be\ncut off and, to make it lighter, I shall make use of the old pig-iron which is very good. Send\nme a note about it, because they have asked to know how much they should make of each\nsort.\n\nThere is also some 'G' iron available which turns out a little harder than the other sort,\nand as it comes from good iron we use it here for hooping heavy wheels as we find it stronger\nand more durable than the other kind. If I knew the breadth which is most often required in\nEngland for binding wagon-wheels I would have one or two sorts made as an experiment.\nPlease send me a note about it, but leave the memorandum open so that Westhuysen(1) can\nsend me a duplicate.\n\nOverseas iron prices are low, and over here most works have made only two-thirds of the\namount they made last year because of the lack of water. As a result, I cannot send you any\nordinary \u2018G\u2019 sheet-iron, though I hope it will be possible to do so next year. Let me also know\nabout \u2018OO\u2019 iron and how suitable it is, as well as the 'L' of which Mr Wilkens has sent you\na quantity this year. Also, let me know if the \u2018OO\u2019 square-iron should be of 1 inch, 1 1/8 inch\nand 1 1/4 inch as well as 1 1/2 inches, and how much of each sort would be best.\n\nAs I am afraid that the ships which are now lying here loading up may not get away in\ntime, and as I have to make some payments at Amsterdam in December, I shall have to ask\nyou to accommodate me with three or four hundred pounds which Westhuysen could draw\nupon you for me, or else you could remit it to him. I shall be glad if it can be done, but please\nlet Amsterdam know how it would suit you best. It will only be for a little while and\nWesthuysen will let you know whether he will need it in December or February.\n\nI had written as far as this when your letter of the 26th of September arrived. I see that the\nships have come and note the amount of pan iron that is required for next year. I shall have it\nmade, in the same assortment as before, and will make sure that it is done properly in order to\nencourage the customers, though in your last letter you wrote that I was not to make the\nthickest sort or, at least, not as they were now made because the ends were not even, but I\nshould now be able to supply them.\n\nIf I pass through Nyk\u00f6ping I shall see if I can speak with the elder Momma. The dispute is\nmaking no progress, et doit plus qu\u2019il n\u2019a de bien.\n\nIron seems to be very dear here, but the exchange on Amsterdam is reckoned at 26 marks\nper dollar, and as the return freight-rates to London are not dear this year it has been possible\nto send it.\n\nConcerning copper-wire, I have told Mr Wouters to inform you how things stand as he is\nbest acquanited with it. I cannot judge whether one can deal safely with him. Pour moy je na\nfay difficulte de lesser de mes effaits entre ces mains et je le trouve vigilent et qu'il pren bien\ngarde a ces affaires.

    "TEXT": "Today is the rst of November and the above, of the 8th of September, is a copy of my last\nletter. I am sure that it has reached you safely as well as the despatched 235 slb [of iron] since\nthe ship passed through the Sound a long while ago. For the rest, I refer you to my letter.\n\nSince then I have received your letters of the 5th and 19th of September, which I should\nhave answered earlier but I have been hoping every day that the iron would arrive and that I\nwould be able to send you the bill of lading. I am extremely annoyed that it is taking so long\nand my Lord De Geer can be my witness that it is no fault of mine, as the wind has always\nbeen so contrary that nothing has been able to come from the works. For six weeks [the iron]\nhas been lying in the barge, somewhere between the works and this city. Secondly, letters\nhave been held up. We have been hoping every week that the posts would go again since\npeace was concluded, but they have been held back until now, so that it is only with this post\nthat one can make a start with the correspondence, since the normal post is leaving.\n\nIn my last letter I wrote to you that I had debited you 8.293 dollars and 15 \u00f6re for the\n235 slb of iron, but in making a record of it I find that I have made an error amounting to I\ndollar 16 6re copper money. In reckoning the Slb. 235.13 of iron @ 31 dollars I had put it\ndown as 7.303 dollars 20 dre, but the total ought really to be 7.305 and 4 6re, so that your net\ndebit on the account of iron stands at 8.294 dollars and 31 \u00f6re, which you will please note and\nforgive the mistake.\n\nHerewith is the bill of lading for the remaining quantity of Slb. 162.4.10 lb. of iron\ndespatched to you aboard Captain Hans Kroger. I have procured a somewhat lower freight-\nrate, but it will have to pay rather more toll since the ship is entirely without a free pass. It can\nbe bought for half dollar or something, so your iron is not too heavily burdened, and I will\ntake care of it as if it were for myself. The last one, in which the 235 slb was shipped, had\npartial freedom and I paid for the rest so that it got total freedom, but this ship has absolutely\nno freedom so something must be paid which we recover through the freight-rate, as we\nhave cheaper freight than before. When the duty is paid an account will be sent to you. The\nshipment will be ready to depart in a few days. He is mostly loaded with tar for the owner\u2019s\naccount.\n\nHendrick Cletcher has transferred to me your power of attorney and other documents\nconcerning Willem Momma at Nyk\u00f6ping and asked me to pursue the matter so that it can be\nbrought to a conclusion. He further says that you gave him instructions to make me such a\nrequest. In fact, you have written nothing to me about it, and it is also a very troublesome\ncommission which looks like being a thankless task, but out of regard for you and at the\npersuasion of Mr Cletcher and also of De Geer I have undertaken it and had your power of\nattorney translated into German and have served it on him, requiring him to answer to me\nabout the account. The son, Isaac Momma, who is here, has answered me in place of his\nfather, who is in Nyk\u00f6ping. He says he will send the copy of the power of attorney to his\nfather and let me know the answer. He was sure that his father would not allow him to come\nto any agreement or compromise until, or before, you debited him in his father\u2019s account\nwith the RD 2.000 which you once wrote (to the said Momma) that you had paid to De\nGeer, but he would let me know his father\u2019s answer. Steven de Geer has refuted all this to\nhim, but it seems that there is little happening, so it is now necessary to learn from you what\nyou want ordered to be done about it if he will not agree to reason, and how much you will\nallow me to deduct from the account, or what else you will concede. I beg you to let me\nknow a little about your views of the matter. I shall know how to manage things properly\nand will try to do the best that is possible for you. The sooner the case is settled the better, for\nat the moment there is something to be hoped for but later there may not perhaps be so\nmuch. I look forward to learning what you have ordered and will govern myself\naccordingly.\n\nI see that the ships will be ready to depart at the earliest in mid-October, so we shall begin\nto get ready for them. It is to be wished that they come soon, with salt selling at 17 dollars. I\nwas selling all mine at 18 dollars, but since the arrival of two Dutch ships and one English it\nhas been running at 17 dollars and as we are selling it daily we hope the price will continue so,\nsince nothing more is expected from Holland, where it is very dear and selling at \u00a364 [flem.].\nMalt, if it is good, will also fetch a lot of money since there is little English malt in stock here.\nIf God grants its arrival I shall take care of your interests as if they were my own, on that you\ncan rely.\n\nI see that in [England] our Swedish wares are very cheap, while here they remain dear. As I\nwrote previously, iron is at 31 to 32 dollars, according to its quality, and there is not much in\nstock. Pitch and tar are as before. There is little tar here, though one can obtain something at\nthe previous price. The Company is sending nothing to Holland as there are sufficient stocks\nthere. Letters from Holland say that the commercial treaty between this Crown and Holland\nhas been concluded.(1) We have not been able to learn the main points yet, but it is not doubted\nthat the Company will come to an end, of which you in [England] will have earlier news than\nus.\n\nAlthough copper prices have dropped so much in Holland, with plenty coming from the\nEast Indies, it still remains dear here and is still selling at 245 dollars. On the exchange it is\n260 dollars and it is the same with copper-wire which is still at 275 dollars, and none selling\nfor less. But the demand is also very bad and there is none to sell. Here in town there are about\n200 slb in stock. A similar amount is expected but there is no one to buy it. The English have\nabsolutely no desire for it, and in the last two months not more than 80 slb have been sent to\n[England], vizt. 70 slb in the month of September and ro slb in the month of October, which\nis very little, and one hears nothing so far that any of it has been sold. If I intend to do\nanything I shall let you know. Now that we have got water all the works are in full\nproduction, but little will come oft this year. Most of the wire is sent to Holland and France, and most of it to the latter. With this I must close, with regards, &c.",

I have ordered the square \u2018O\u2019\niron to be made so that it can be sent to you in the spring, as it was before, but as for the sheet\niron of 3 1/4 and 3 1/2 inches thick I have not ordered it because it would be too thick, and thus\nunsaleable. Instead I have ordered them to make the sheets of the usual breadths but as light as\npossible. However, in reply please send me a paper showing the thickness and breadth [you\nrequire] so that I can judge whether it can be made, for I have been an iron-master for over 54\nyears.\n\nRegarding the voyage iron for Genoa\u2014we get it made inland, from Luxemburg and\nGermany and could easily deliver it here to the agent for 76 and 78 guilders per ton, in a large\nquantity.

Cinnamon, as you say,\n\nsould to deare in Holland to turne to account here, but by the clovs I hope you will make a\n\nbetter businesse. Wax beeing so cheape in London, here\u2019s a good quantitie come. I suppose\n\nyou finde it comes cheaper thence then it can be had in England. Of the barragans I have sould\n\nabout 1/2 and shall putt of the rest by all occasions. Mr Duquesnoy writes me they are fallen at\nVallencia, but I observe the exchange is also lower for London which may make them as\ndeare to you. If you find it otherwyse and that the pryse is considerably lower that they may\nbe sent with more conveniency, they are a sound comodity, but pray order him to keep to\ntheir goodnesse for others send better goods. All goods there as well as in England are\ngenerally provyded on better tearmes in the winter, and the spring here I find the best time\nfor sale. Hose of Tournoy are here a current comodity and many sell. I cannot tell what\naccount they may produce, haveing never sould any. He is acquanted with the sort propper,\nand I have sent Sir John a muster of picotes, which he hath sent Duquesnoy. Is a comodity\nhath good vent here, if they can be had at about 12 reals per piece, as they might lately; also\npelos de camelo, the broader sort, which are worth here 4 1/2 to 5 R. pta. per vare as in goodnesse,\nbut these goods must be bought in when cheape and the exchange favourable to turne to\naccount. Of the pepper I had sould 12 baggs at 44 R. vn ere till had any news\u2019twas risen in\nEngland and Holland. The rest I hope to putt of at a better rate, but your tarre I feare will\nyeald but a slender account, here beeinge a good parcell more arrived and the consumption of\nthat comodity here is but litle. I shall make the most of it I can. Sir John advyseth mee of 12\nballs of Russia hydes he hath loaden in Roch, 4 for your account. I shall sell them for the most\nthey will yeald and hope there may be reasonable advantage thereby. Bays, I observe, weare\nrisen at home to 22d per ell. Its not impossible but they may keepe up, the flota goeing for the\nIndies in June and the Galleons in September or October next. It would be amisse to buy them\ndeare if they should fall and be brought cheaper, but if they fall not at home I am perswaded\nthey will ryse proportionable here, as they have donne for some monethes and seaverall\naccounts I have lately sent home of them have yealded well. Here are moreover few in towne,\nand if they fall not at home I beleeve verry few will be sent, for your government. In the\nspring and summer that\u2019s a comodity goes presently offe and lesse proffit may satisfie then by\nother goods which ly by long and sell to worse paymasters, as pressillias whereof I have some\nof Sir John\u2019s I cannot sell. I never writt for them. If you order any more baragans or any other\nFlaunders good let them come by way of Dunckerke. Ther\u2019s lesse charge on them and they\ncome free of the danger of Turkes. I observe Mr Duquesnoy\u2019s intention was to have some of\nthe goods consigned to another. I thinck he hath litle reason, for yours weare I suppose\nprovyded by him by my meanes. I thanck your friendship, as I have more than a treble obligation in what soever I can serve you I will with a particuler sense and reallity.

We note that, notwithstanding your former advice,\nmuch tarr was shipping off for these parts, which newes wee understand alsoo from other\npenns, which comeing to the Ittallians notice, as undoubtedly must, will keepe them from\nbuying any, though ours should gitt the startt. This is the worse, and if soe must be landed\nrather then goe at loss. In fine, yew may rest assured our utmost studies shalbe imployed to\nadvantadge your intrist all lay in our powers, giveing yew due advice of what further passeth.\nWhat our 1/4 proportion of charges amounts to in the man\u2019s dispatch to Plymouth may please\nto note in our debts.

In reply, I must say in a friendly way that I\ncannot exactly follow your order for the reason that the money only falls due at the end of\nJanuary and February, and then there is no iron to be obtained; and if there is any to be\nobtained now it must be by means of money\u2014but that is not due yet. Now, for the space ofa\nweek or a fortnight, is a rest-period when those with money travel up-country to provide the\nworks with everything they need, such as coal and ore which is used in the making of iron.\nHowever, as it is up to me to take care of your interests so that your money is not lying idle,\nand in order that you should profit from the low price of iron, I sent to a person two days ago,\nwho was on the point of selling to another but gave me preference, and agreed with him for\n400 slb of iron, of which 200 slb will be ordinary sheet-iron, 100 slb broad, schampelion iron\nand 100 slb square iron, to deliver here in Stockholm with the first open water at 27 dollars\n[per slb]. He takes over the bills of exchange and will discount them or negotiate them as best\nhe can, though I remain liable for any failure of payment.\n\nThe iron is of good material which has been always sent, year after year, to one Mr\nStrodder(1) in England. The works once belonged to Utterclo(2) and its mark is \u2018XX\u2019 but the\nworks have now been sold to another and it is with him that I have contracted, and I am\nassured that we will be well treated. Mr Strodder, the English merchant, gave 30 dollars for\niron last year. There are 200 slb lying ready at the works which I can have immediately. But it\nis a pity that you did not write how broad the schampelion should be. It has been ordered in\nvarious breadths. Please let me know at once in answer to this so it can reach me in time.\n\nI have no doubt that you will be well satisfied with this business, but orgronds iron was not\nto be obtained. For the 400 slb at 27 dollars you owe me 10.800 dollars, against which we can\nset the bills of exchange unless their payment fails, which I trust it will not. If it should please\nyou to place this order as it suits you (for this consignment will not be disadvantageous for\nyou) I shall be able to help you with further amounts.

After that, winter descended and although we have had little frost and the waters remain\n\nnavigable the damaging west wind has lasted for three weeks and has gathered a great\n\nnumber of ships here. There are at least 350, large vessels as well as small, among which are\n\n100 laden with oats destined for France, but the west wind keeps them all in, which is very\nvexing. However, since they will be going in the spring we must hope for an improvement in\nour lives and that trade will go rather more briskly. Meanwhile, thank you for the prices of\nsundry goods as well as your opinions on one thing or another. I beg you to continue sending\nthem occasionally as well as news ifany changes occur in the following commodities, such as\nsilk, pepper, ginger and gall-nuts.

I await your opinion on the matter.\n\nThe ship of which you were thinking, which came here \u2018adritura\u2019 with 200 sacks, brought\nonly poor, small stuff which will not sell. Two or four sacks were sold for about 43 ML [per\n100 lb.] but good quality can fetch as much as 46 or 47 ML.

Since\ngoods there are nearly all dearer than here it seems that the trade between here and there must\nperish, for over there they are maintained at high prices and are sent over here by the owners\nbut as soon as they arrive they are sold for what they will fetch, which is ruining trade.\nBarbary almonds are sold here thus, which because they can be freely brought to [London]\ncan be profitably sent here at 40s. Silk is also sold here for poor prices, so that I cannot make\nup my mind to invest 9s [per lb.] for them in [London]. It will have to wait until next May,\nwhen probably quite enough will arrive. I do not believe that the currants which have been\nsent here will do very well, for a good quantity are expected to come here addrittura.\n\nThat the East India Company is holding a sale on the 9th of March I have noted, and when\nI receive the details I shall at once consider them and if I decide on any purchases I shall let you\nknow.

Please see if you could not obtain some for less from\nsomeone in need of cash, though it must be of good quality, otherwise my balance may as\nwell as lie in London.\n\nEnclosed herewith I am sending a note about the weights of the 10 hogsheads of Jamaican\nsugar. Please show it to the man who sold them to youso that he can see what is lacking. The\nweights are only of the casks, from which 3/4 per cent was deducted here, and a hundred-\nweight in [England] must yield 104 lb. here. Captain Lomax brought all his crew ashore in\norder to take oath, but I did not want that since I would then have had to pay all the expenses\nhere, and I did not know if I could obtain anything in [London]. Now Lomax is no longer\nhere and it is too late for his people to swear. Since you still have the seller in hand he will have\nto be satisfied with the note, though ifhe will not believe honourable people I shall send him a\nnotarial deed, provided that he pays the expenses. If, in addition, I could send you the\ntestimony of the crew it would already have been sent to you. I urge you to take care of my\ninterests as if they were your own.\n\nEnclosed I send you the account of the remaining Bermuda tobacco, of which your\npromised half is \u00a369 8s og, for which I shall give you credit if the money is paid in. Please\ncheck the account, and if you find no mistakes, please make a record of it. I also remit you\nherewith, for your account, \u00a3100 at double usance in a bill of Jan & H. Louis drawn on\nPickering & Robinson. Please procure the necessary and credit me with \u00a3171 13s 4g at\n34s 4g [per \u00a31 sterling]. The second copy of the bill for 500 ducats is not yet here; it will be sent to you later. Please send my current account as soon as possible. With cordial regards,\n&c.\n\n[P.S.] Ifyou cannot effect my commission for sugar but can obtain good campeachy-wood at\n9s, free on board, please buy me another 200 cwt. and send with another captain for the least\npossible freight, though if the sugar has been bought buy no campeachy-wood.

    "TEXT": "I have been unavoidably detained here for a long while by an accident which happened about\nfive weeks ago to my leg, which was broken clean through just above the ankle, though\nnow\u2014God be thanked \u2014it has improved so much that I am beginning to get up and I hope\nwithin a fortnight to be completely recovered, without any impediment.\n\nThis has prevented the journey which I was planning to take to Nyk\u00f6ping, so I have been\nunable to do anything about your suit with Momma. With Mr Cletscher things stand as\nbefore, for he will not waive any of the interest since the debt is too great, though about the\nsalt-licence he is not doing much good. There too there is some good reason for it, but it has\nbeen caused by his own fault. I have told him it is cheap, and as soon as the repayment comes\nin from others I shall settle it in order to close the account.\n\nI am glad that the pan-iron was found to be so good. That which is now being made will\nbe done in the same way, and the coarseness removed from it.\n\nIt is not feasible to make the 3-inch sheet-iron only 1/4-inch thick. It would bend about, for\neven the smallest iron cannot be made 1/4-inch thick, but I shall have it forged as thin as\npossible. Let me know at once if more will be paid for it than for the \u2018OO\u2019 or the 'L', for it\nmust sell for more, otherwise it will have to be sent to Amsterdam, though as an experiment I\nshall send you some.\n\nIt must have slipped my memory, but according to my calculations I should still have a\nbalance of about \u00a3300 with you if the proceeds of the last lot of pan-iron and the total on the\nThomazine have been paid up, unless I have made a mistake. You can expect more pan-iron\nand other iron as soon as we have open waters.\n\nLet me know at once what ships you have chartered to go to St Ubes and then come here,\nand at what price, and when you estimate they can arrive here. Also, whether many grain\nships are going to the Straits this autumn from your area. In these regions we are having a\npretty tolerable winter, not very severe, and all the rivers are flowing so supplies are readily\nobtainable. I shall be glad to know if iron has been enjoying some sales with you and what\nyou think about it. The high rate of exchange will remain as it was last year and all the\nprincipal iron-works have made contracts accordingly.\n\nIt would have been a good thing if I had know that you were favourably inclined towards\none or other of the works apart from the 'L'. There were about 4.000 to 5.000 slb made this\nyear and they were mostly shared, one half to London and the other half to Amsterdam. It is\nnow much too late, but otherwise I should certainly have despatched some. One now draws\non Amsterdam at 26 1/2 to 27 marks per RD. I could have obtained that iron for 31 dollars but I\nwould guess that others now have to give 32. It stands at about [illegible].\n\nThis mishap will rather delay me in all my affairs and I shall have to remain rather longer in the country than I intended. Wishing you all happiness and success in this new year and many\nothers to come, I remain, &c.\n\n[P.S.] Your letter of the 25th of November has arrived at last.",

    "TEXT": "This serves only to say that for some time I have had one case of Jauwers linen and one case of\nSloyers in the hands of Mr James Bancks in [London] which he says he cannot sell. I think that\nis strange, seeing that linen is daily rising in price here. From time to time I sell plenty of the\nsame sort to the English here who send it to [England] themselves and do well with it. So I\nsuspect that, because the said James Bancks and his brother John Bancks especially trade\nactively in linen themselves and because they know that I have as good an opportunity to do\nso as they, they do not want to serve me with regard to linen and by not being able to sell any\nhope to make me decide not to send any more to England so that I will no longer be any\nobstacle to them. I wrote to him to this effect, since I saw that he could not sell any, and said\nthat I had the opportunity to sell them to a friend here over a year ago, to which he replied\nthat he would be delighted to transfer them to whomsoever I might order.\n\nThus (in order not to invite any jealousy that the transfer might occasion, since James\nBancks in [London] and Charles Bancks over here are my good friends) I have today drawn\nup a deed of assignment that the said two cases are to be transferred at the order of my brother\n[-in-law] Jean Baptista d\u2019Hertogh, and this has been endorsed by him to you pro forma. It\ncomes herewith. So I ask you to send this assignment to Mr James Bancks and demand the\naforesaid two cases to be transferred on presentation of my assignment, mentioning nothing\nmore than that you are doing this on the orders of my brother [-in-law] Jean Baptista, and\nthat it is for his account. By doing this you will oblige me greatly, and if you will sell the said\nJauwers and Sloyers to my greatest advantage, either for cash or to people without liabilities,\nand if the experiment succeeds I shall keep you always supplied with these and other sorts of\nlinen suitable for [England].\n\nYou do not have to pay Mr Bancks any charges or anything else for them since I have\nwritten to him that I will make it good to his brother Charles here. In order to know that they\nreally are my cases they should, in addition to my usual mark in black on the lid, be marked\nwith a red mark thus, 'Z'. The case of linen [Jauwers] is also marked \u2018No. 5\u2019 and the case of\nSloyers 'F'. Perhaps, through standing around so long, the paper wrapping on the Jauwers\nand Sloyers have become rather unsightly and soiled, so please take off some layers and put\nfresh pieces on top which you can let the buyers see first, and then let me know what they can\nsell for.\n\nThe dry weather continues and we may well have a short winter and be able to commence\nthe sailing season somewhat earlier. Your advice to my sister Mahuis about prices will be\nuseful for my consideration so that if the peace holds and the clouds of war pass by we can make a trial of something or other. May the Almighty protect you. With cordial regards, I\nremain, &c.",

(on\narryval) in Madrid, which wil be about 17 1/4 silver neat, and at that rate as your returnes goe\nhome and the goods cost you, you wil get 20 per cent. This is a staple commodity.

Neither he nor Adriansen have yet appeared.(1) For\nsome days we have had a south wind (though it is at present westerly) so we hope to hear of\nthem in a few days time. God bring them safely!\n\nWe have still not heard from Mr Focken about his settlement of the disagreement with the\nowners of the Noot Muscatenboom(2) but Mr Jacobsen has today shown us information in his\nown hand to that effect, sent to him by the captain who ordered him to take custody of the\nmoney into his own hands and keep it until he arrives here\u2014whereupon we informed him\nthat we had your order to receive your share and also Mr Radue\u2019s. We will come to an\nagreement with him and say no more about it.\n\nIf Capt. Hendrick Claesen arrives here we will advance him your one-eighth share of the\nfreight money, which we will make over to Caspar Bruyn together with the proceeds of\nyour goods sent by him aboard Capt. Adriansen.\n\nYou urge us to assist all the captains of any ships in which you have a part-interest. This we\nshall do to the best of our ability, as if for ourselves, but we do not understand whether the\ncaptains have orders from all the part-owners to address themselves to us. Meanwhile we will\nextend our help to any that come to our knowledge.\n\nYou will have seen our order to procure the purchase of 2.000 slb of iron\u2014vizt. 1/4-part\nbroad, 1/2 small, and 1/4 square. Please get it at the keenest price and make sure it is in good, even\nand equal sizes\u2014the square and small iron the lighter the better, of 9, 10, 11 or 12 feet long,\nbut the broad ought to be according to the enclosed design(3) which is of a kind that comes\nfrom [Sweden] via Hamburg and is stamped with an \u2018F\u2019, which sells well here (if there is not\ntoo much of it) and is of the same type that we are asking for. As for the necessary purchase\nmoney, we have ordered you to draw at once RD 2.000 on Antoine dela Bistrate. If you have\nthe opportunity of doing so profitably for us you can go up to six thousand rix-dollars and\nyour bills will be promptly paid.\n\nConcerning your proposal that we should accommodate you (here, as is customarily done\nin Amsterdam) with money advanced upon the goods shipped here, we say that it can be\ndone, as long as it is not too much or too often. As you will have observed from our\npreceding letter, we could easily go up to four, five or six hundred pounds per ship, but we do\nnot find it advisable to have the insurance done here as most of our insurers are not to our\n\nliking. In case of a loss one has to wait, 3, 4 or 6 months, and then they deduct 15 or at least\n10 per cent, as well as the premium, before they pay up. Therefore it is better to have it done\nin Hamburg or Amsterdam by those friends on whom you could draw the money, ordering\nthem to reimburse themselves upon us. If you want the business to remain with us we shall\narrange the insurance with the rest, remaining satisfied with 1/2 per cent for any outlay. And\niron, copper or copper-wire will always sell freely, so we are in no fear of over-supplying the\nmarket except at some times when for one or two months the market is somewhat quieter\nthan at other times; but that is to be expected in all places.\n\nWe have written to Caspar Bruyn today, following your order, that he may draw \u00a3200 on us; wherewith our cordial regards, &c.",

We have since\nreceived your welcome letter of 14 February and note what is happening with regard to our\ncommission\u2014that the broad and square iron is being worked now\u2014but we would hope that\nyou do not have to pay 26 dollars [per slb] for it, as that is much too high, all the more so in\nview of the great danger it will run at sea if the Danes fall out with the Swedish Crown,\nwhich is to be feared, so that 24 dollars would be quite enough. However, we shall rely on\nyour discretion to manage matters as if yourself, trusting that the iron will be evenly forged\nfrom good material, according to our request. Speedy despatch is very important, so we urge\nyou to look out for Abr. Laurens or some other good skipper, and if the Sound should\nbecome closed to your ships it would be best if you loaded everything aboard a Dutch ship\nbound for Amsterdam, though the ship may come here for the decree forbidding that is not\nmuch observed now, and the captain could give out (when he is here) that he is a Swede so\nthat there is no further dispute. Please give us timely advice of everything, and also to Ant. de\nla Bistrate, so that we can act accordingly.\n\nWe shall send youa sample of the copper rods at the earliest Opportunity, as you requested.\nWe have already informed you about what we paid for your account to Capt. Hendrick\nClaesen and remitted to Caspar Bruyn at Amsterdam, to whom we have today remitted in\nour own bill \u00a3200 @ 34s 10g at 2 usances on Pilgrom & Arnout ten Groot Huysen, for\nwhich you will please credit us.\n\nAll kinds of commodities remain as in the copy above, only saltpetre is driven up to 80s per\ncwt., great quantities having been bought up for sending to Holland and Hamburg, but on\nthe arrival of the ships from the Indies in May or June it will again fall to 73s or below. That\ncommodity is always bought here for cash, but as you ask for something in return for iron we could accommodate you with the outlay of the money, or draw on Amsterdam; wherewith,\nour cordial regards, &c.",

    "TEXT": "My last to you was on the 4th of March, by which I advised you that I had remitted for your\naccount to Messrs Jean & David van Baerle \u00a3320 @ 35s 2g at 2 usances in two bills, as\nfollows:\n\nSince then I have heard nothing from you, so this will serve to enclose your current account\nby which a balance of \u00a3489 12s 7d remains due to me, which I have carried to your debt in a\nnew account, without prejudice to me for any debts which I have discounted. Below the\naccount is a specification of the interest placed to your debit. Please examine it and, finding it\ncorrect, please note it and drop me a line about your findings.\nOf the wire, I have sold to William Wathing 74 coils at \u00a36 10s per cwt. payable in 6\nmonths. I shall do my duty with the remainder and let you know what happens. Meanwhile I\nam extremely sorry that it is going so sluggishly,! but one cannot do more than one\u2019s best,\nand it is commonly the case that when one has brought a commodity up to a high price the\nretailers do all that they can to avoid buying anything and to discourage one, and if they do\nbuy anything it is only because they have no more, either to sell or work with. That is what\nthey are doing now, and what they buy is only in small parcels and that only when it is\nabsolutely necessary. However, it is my intention to keep the price up and I think I have good\nreason for doing so for there is only a little in town and that is all in my hands, besides which\nthe prospect is that it will be two months before any more comes from [Sweden]. A person\nhas offered me \u00a36 at 3 months for all which I have but I have refused him, considering it is\nbetter to do so and maintain the price in reputation until the first consignments arrive from\n[Sweden]. Thus, it is impossible to establish a new price-level unless there is an upsurge of\ndemand, and then I shall be selling quantities all through the week, so that before long you\ncan expect an account of it.\n\nMeanwhile I would be glad to learn what amounts you intend to consign to me. You\nwould do well to send some copper bars as soon as possible as several ships will soon be\ngetting ready to sail for Guinea and this commodity will be in demand, for there is none of it\nin town and large amounts will be required. Hungary plates, \u00a36 10s; garcopper \u00a35 185;\nsheet copper \u00a36 18s. Iron is also in request\u2014square, broad and small iron selling at 145 6d\n[per cwt.]. Gothenburg deals are very dear, selling at \u00a36 per cwt., and others accordingly.\n\nIt has been said to me that you have agreed with our other friends in Sweden to consign all\nthe copper-wire (which this place can consume) to one hand, but I believe that this has not yet\nbeen finally concluded for nothing has been written to me about it. If something like this has\nbeen decided I beg you to make me a participant. I have always sought every opportunity to\nprocure your profit as if it were my own, and as the exchange has fallen so much I am very glad that I have remitted so much for your account at an advantageous price.

    "TEXT": "My last letter to you was a fortnight ago accompanied by your current account, by which a\nbalance of \u00a3489 12s 7d is due to me. With it I gave you news of the sale of 74 coils of copper-\nwire at \u00a36 10s per cwt. to William Wathing. Since then I have received yours of the 28th of\nFebruary from which I see that you have returned home in good health, which I am very glad\nto learn. God grant that you may long remain so.\n\nI see that you have received the sale account of the 2.357 coils of wire, found it correct and\nthus made a record of it, which is good. Of the remaining copper-wire I have sold 150 coils to\nNathaniel Humphreys and others at \u00a36 6s per cwt., which you will please make a note of. I\nhad thought of continuing the price at \u00a36 10s but there is always someone who will\ninterfere, be it well or badly. This certain person, who has received several consignments\n\nfrom [Sweden], has had 200 coils from Hamburg which, as soon as it arrived, he sent a barge\n\nalongside to fetch the 200 coils and went selling it at \u00a36 5s per cwt, payable in 4 months\n\naccording to what the buyer tells me, which is 5s below the market price. I cannot conceive\n\nwhat his purpose is in doing so but, meanwhile, that is the reason why I have had to sell at\n\n\u00a36 6s. How would it have been if the consignment had been bigger? I fear it would have\ngone badly. Therefore I would be very glad if you gentlemen [in Sweden] could agree to\nsend all your copper-wire to me here, so that with all of it in one hand the price could be\nmaintained and our friends could make a profit. I am inclined to believe that that will come to\npass (which I heartily wish for) for my Lord Cronstr\u00f6m informed me in his letter of\n19 February that, upon the return to Stockholm of Abraham Wolters from Hamburg, I shall\nbe sent some terms of correspondence and that he has recommended me. Whatever may\ncome of it I shall be glad to learn for I would be happy to see your trade flourish, of which\nthere is a sufficient prospect as it would be of great advantage to those gentlemen. For me,\nthat is the most important consideration, and I look out for any way of serving you better;\nand, in order to encourage our friends in this matter I shall be content (with regard to the\ntrade in copper-wire and copper-wares) with 1 1/2 per cent commission and 5 per cent per\nannum for interest on money advanced upon current account. As regards discount, that\nwould continue at 6 per cent as most of the debts only get paid in cash 1, 2 or 3 months after\nthe due date. You could put this proposal (if it suits you) to our other friends and I have no\ndoubt that it will greatly facilitate the business.\n\nAs regards the sale of goods, you will have no reason for anything but satisfaction, and the\ninterests of our friends will always remain uppermost with me. Please now write to our\nfriends to submit this proposal and let me know what success you have. I would not trouble\nyou with this if it were not that the matter concerns you principally, so I hope you will forgive me. Yours, &c.",

    "TEXT": "My last letter to you was about a week ago, to which I refer. I have since had your very\nwelcome letters of the 25th and 29th of April and 6th of May. With the first I see that I run a\ngreat risk of losing my good old correspondents; with the second you give me reason to hope\nthat you will stand by me, and with the last you confirm that you will continue with me and\nthereupon order me to get insured for \u00a35.000 the goods which you propose to consign to me\nin the ship called t\u2019Graffelycke Huys de la Gardie, which I shall negotiate to have done at the\nbest possible terms and will inform you when I succeed. Meanwhile, I am waiting for the bill\nof lading and beg God to bring the ship and its cargo in safety, and whenever it arrives I shall\ndo the utmost within my powers to sell the goods for your greatest profit. One pays 2 per\ncent here for insurance from Stockholm, and I hope to be able to select good insurers at that\nprice, for which I shall do my best.\n\nBy way of answer to your welcome letters I must say, truthfully, that your complaints\nhave upset me not a little, for I have not been accustomed to hear such things from my\nfriends, though my comfort has been that you would find me innocent of the intention\nwhich you charge me with. For the \u00a3200 formerly drawn by you on me, payable to the\norder of Antony Bruyn, has been fulfilled by me without the least delay or disrespect to your\nbill, and I shall reimburse myself from the effects which you will be sending me this spring. It\nis true that in passing I wrote a word about it to the Messrs Van Baerle asking, if they did not\nmind, if might set it against the account of goods which I had in hand; but I never sought nor\nin the least intended to reimburse myself out of the goods which I had in hand, or to divert\nanything against their intentions or goodwill. They misunderstood what I wrote, and as soon\nas I had their answer about the bill (the \u00a3200 being by then already paid) I wrote back to\nthem without a moment\u2019s loss that they had badly interpreted my letter and that\u2014as I have\nsaid above\u2014I only wanted to be reimbursed from the promised effects; and since they\ninformed me that they had written to you about the matter as they understood it, so I begged\nyou to forgive the blunder and to think no more about it, as I now do, hoping that no such\nerror will recur again.\n\nNow, I rejoice from the bottom of my heart that my proposal came in time to confirm our\ncorrespondence, and the conditions which I therewith offered I confirm with this, trusting\nthat you and the other friends will be content with them and do nothing to reduce the\ncommission. I can well believe that some people from other places may offer to serve you for\n1 per cent commission (although that is very little for a person who wants to do his duty\nproperly) but London differs considerably from other places, and I would say that a person\ncan profit more in Hamburg by working for 1 per cent than here for 2 per cent, and one can\ndo more there with one servant than here with two; for over there they have banks where\nmost money is paid; the town is small, and thus all your debtors are under your eye; there are\nfew difficulties in the Customs house; great quantities are bought, mainly for re-export\nelsewhere, and for cash. But here it is different. We have to receive and pay outall our money\nourselves, and the town is large and many customers live 2 or 3 miles from the Exchange, to\nwhom one has to run, which causes expense and for which several people have to be\nemployed. The trouble we have with our customs officials is impossible to describe, for there\nis no question, quibble or quirk but they know how to torment the merchant with it; and\nthen, in order to sell the goods, one has to deal with people who will only buy small quantities\nand then take pleasure in making me and my servants run after them for payment over 2 or 3\nmonths; so, considering all that, I hope you will think and believe that my commission is very\nreasonable and be satisfied that, as regards the iron, the commission may also be reckoned at\n1 1/2 per cent.\n\nIf you give orders to draw some sum on me at the same time that you send the bill of\nlading and instructions for insurance, as you are proposing, I shall follow your orders on the\nunderstanding that your intention will be to draw only a part of the value of the goods, for an\ninsurance policy cannot be thought of as complete cover\u2014firstly, because it is customary\nhere in case ofa loss (from which, may God preserve us!) for the insurers to deduct usually 10,\n12 or 15 per cent of the principal, and thus the premium here is always smaller than at\nAmsterdam or Hamburg, &c; but if the goods have arrived here I shall be always ready to\nadvance three-quarters or more of the value, either by remitting the money or having it\ndrawn on me, as it suits you.\n\nOne reason which has impelled me to want to serve our friends for 1 1/2 per cent commission\nand 5 per cent per annum interest has been to be excused from advancing anything before I\nfirst have goods in hand, so that some of my clients\u2014who entrust me with considerable\nsums\u2014may be so much the easier in their minds. However, in order to demonstrate to you\nmy affection and respect, I shall be happy to extend a thousand or twelve hundred pounds\nadvance during the winter to be reimbursed by you in the spring, just as you have proposed,\nnever in the least doubting your punctuality. I beg you to say or write nothing about this to\nanyone because I am not contemplating advancing anything to other friends in such a\nmanner, and whenever they learn that one is allowing one friend such terms they think they\nhave a right to demand similar ones.\n\nI heartily wish you had informed me about your displeasure over what I wrote to Messrs\nVan Baerle concerning the aforementioned \u00a3200, and I thank you warmly for telling me\nabout it now, begging you in our future friendship to write to me if it should ever happen\nthat you have some occasion for displeasure; and I promise you that I shall respond in such a\nWay as to remove all misunderstanding, for some time things can be said or done with the\nbest of intentions (or, at least, without evil intentions) which being otherwise interpreted can turn out badly. Wherewith, cordial regards, &c.",
