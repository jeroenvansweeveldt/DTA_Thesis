    "TEXT": "My Letter to Mrs Wenborn of Mayfield who before was the wife of Mr John\nWilmshurst*\n\nGodly friend\n\nYou may thinke me too bold in presuming to present these confused lines\nunto your view, which will but trouble you to read but more trouble to me to\nwrite in regard of the old friendship & acquaintance betweene you & my\nmother having now this opportunity could not but acquaint you with that\nwhich I wish rather you had beene an eye witness of, even the death of my\ndearest friend under God. It is now .22. weekes ago she finished her course,\nshe sickened first like an Ague, upon the 29\" of October being Tuesday, on\nthe wednesday she went out to Goodman Millers to repetition, the thursday\nthe fit tooke her againe & held her as before, & on the friday she went out to\na buriall which was the last time she was forth. On the Saterday she was tooke\nagaine & so it held her all night & the next day being Sabbath she was very\nsicke, yet in the Afternoone she rose, but still continuing sicke, on the Monday\nas she lay, she read the .102. Psalme,\" for the Lord seemed to hide himselfe\nfrom her, but he did not forsake her over long, in that night hee revealed himselfe\nto her in a sweet manner, so that her bruised bones leapt for joy, in the\nmorning she revealed to us what a sweet night she had enjoyed, & how the\nLord had let out him selfe to her from these words of the .36. Psalme 5.6.7.8.9.\nverses\" and that now she had found by experience what we have yet but by\npromise, that heaviness may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning.\nContinuing sicke we sought to the Physician, this weeke like a Saint, her\nwords ministered grace to the hearers, & she was perswaded she should dye\non the Sabbath & that having done a weekes work she should enter into his\nrest yet God otherwise prevented & that Satan might take his last farewell of\ntroubling her tooke occasion hereby to molest her but at length the Lord\nrevealed himselfe to her more fully then before, so that about the middle of the\nweeke she told us she was as full of joy as her heart could hold. The Lord had\nnow afflicted her with a sore mouth, which much troubled her to speake, about\nthe latter end of the weeke we had good hope of her recovery, but God ordered\nit better for her gaine though for our losse, on the saterday night & Sabbath\nfollowing she could take downe nothing but beere & suger with a feather & on\nthe monday & tuesday she waxing worse & worse, we had little hope of life left\nin her, on the Wednesday being the .20\". day of November about .4. a clocke in\nthe afternoone she sweetly yielded up her soule into her Fathers hands, catching\nup her hands together uttered these words Come Lord but what more could not\nbe heard. Thus as you had acquaintance of her in her life, you are acquainted\nwith a true relation of her death, that you may rejoyce with her & weepe with\nme, & that God to whom alone belong the issues of life & death helpe us to\nglorifie him in either of both conditions.

I have now received\nyour Letter, wherein you charge me with divers & severall false positions, at\nwhich I marvaile but I pray expect not such a circumspect answer as if I had\nlearned the [words struck out] art to comprehend much matter in a few lines,\nor as if I had a helper to instruct & teach me, yet thinke not that it shall\naltogether die in silence when as for what I spoke I know how to answere if I\ngoe awry teach me & I will learne, raise me to understand where in I have\nerred.\n\nFirst you impute to me, that I should report you hold and maintaine\n\nlangerous errors before ignorant people &tc. to notifie to you the words that\n\nthen said in every particular as neere as I can remember (speaking the truth\nin Christ before whose dreadfull tribunall I must give accompt as of all my\nwords & workes, so of this also whether they be good or evill) were these, that\nsome of your Reasons to uphold praying for the Fornicator, & the words,\nDeare Sister, at the buriall of the Papist were very weake.\n\nAnd now to insist a little larger on it, you would go about to prove it, you\nbring me scripture indeed, which as I conceive are nothing correspondent to\nthe purpose, you quote me the precept of Christ & example of Steven, which\ninstances onely praying for our enemies. I conceive there to be two sorts of\nenemies to be praied for & that after a double manner, the enemies of the\nChurch of God in generall and our owne enemies in particular. For the first\nsort we are to pray either for their conversion (because we know not whether\nthey belong to God or no) or confusion (as David imprecates in some of his\nPsalmes against such enemies) & this may be done in the publicke congregation.\nFor our owne particular enemies, we may pray for them generally in the\npublicke congregation but not particularly, for if any have wronged abused or\nreviled us, so as it tends to the dishonour of God & scandall of his Gospell,\nthough we are to forgive them in our heart & earnestly pray for their pardon\n& to qualifie our heat of malice with some affection of love: Yet not to testifie\nour forgiveness outwardly by praying for them publiquely till such time as\nthey seeke reconciliation & submit themselves lest we confirme the verity of\nthe former & insure the like upon our selves in future times.\n\nNow for your place in Jeremy 29.7.\" where the prophet exhorts the people\nof the Jewes, to pray for the peace and prosperity of the city whether they\nwere led captive producing this reason for in the peace of that, they shall have\npeace. Those words as I perceive are no proofe of the point in hand, when the\nprophets drift is to teach & divert the people how to undergoe their captivity\nwith the more ease by praying that the city might be at peace freed from\ntrouble & warre & perplexity, for they being there resident, if any such combustions\nbe must be sure to share in them, therefore seeke the prosperity of\nthe city & pray to the Lord for it, that so they might with the more patience &\nlesse grief waite upon God, for the time of their deliverance, not for any affection\nthat the Prophet beareth to the Tyrant or to the City (which may seeme\nif you take the words too literally) noe for not onely the Israelites but all the\nworld yea & the very insensible creatures should rejoyce when these Tyrants\nshould be destroyed as we may read Isaiah .14. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. & so forward.*\n\nAnd for that in Samuel, unlesse you will prove the Israelites to be such as\nshe is, is very impertinent, but if it were soe (which is a gross falsity to thinke,)\nyet its to no purpose for first its a question whether he praied for them in\nprivate or in publique, but if he did pray for them in publique, yet they first\nconfess their sinnes & humble them selves openly before him, but you may tell\nme, so did she in regard she sent to be praied for, but it is apparent to the\ncontrary whatever she seemingly pretends, witness her vile words spoken to\none that professt Godlyness, about that time, which though she now deny yet\ncan be justified on oath to the contrary, so that it is cleare she had no love nor\nliking to the waies of God, neither to humiliation nor prayer but onely to\nhave her sickness removed (which many an honest woman endures more in\nthe common disease of child bearing) it's true we must judge charitably, but\ncharity judges not absolutely not peremptorily & though it hope well of all\nthings: yet it is not a toole to conclude all things. Again the prophet convicts\nthem of & laies open unto them the hainousness of their sinne & reproves\nthem sharpely & severely for it, & that before he prayes for or at the least\nmanifests his prayer to them which may be plainly seene by viewing the\ncontext, which if she had beene (as the manner of some other reformed\nchurches are) I could have held well with. But for to be praied for in the\npublique congregation before she had testified her humiliation & repentance\n& before she had beene soundly reproved, I cannot thinke to be lawfull since\nher fault was so scandalous, lest it were a countenancing of her in it. For the\nApostle saith plaine .1.Tim. 5. 20.\" them that sinne rebuke openly that the\nrest may feare, thus much for that.\n\nNow for your Reasons to prove the words Deare Sister at the buriall of\nthe Papist to be lawful, I thinke them little lesse than cavills, it's true, we had\nall one father by creation, & we are all by nature the children of wrath, but\nnow nature is changed by grace in the godly & old things are passed away, &\nwe are now no more strangers & foreiners but citizens with the saints &\nhoushold of God, and now what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness\nwhat communion hath light with darkness? What concord hath\nChrist with Belial? and what part hath a believer with an Infidell? I leave to\nthe learned to judge.\n\nAnd for her profession, I pray how did she professe Jesus Christ, was it\nnot after a wrong manner? are not all the tenents of the papisticall religion for\nthe most part egregious & pernicious errors, derogatory to the honour &\ndignity of Christ, and that in a high degree, I presume your selfe can witness,\nnay she was an Infidell being a papist, for they deny the faith of us Christians\n& cleave to the covenant of workes which is now abrogated, and no man 1s\nable to performe neither is any man justified by it. Gal. 3. 11.\"\u00b0 And as I said\nbefore what communion or fellowship hath a believer with them? And especially\nin such a neere bond of relation as to be a Sister or Brother to them by\nprofession. I thinke it little lesse then to partake of their sinnes, wherein we\nlye lyable to partake of her plagues.\n\nAnd for Baptisme, when she was baptized she knew not what she did, but\nothers were surely for her, which when she came to age, was bound to\nperforme, but refused (violating her covenant she there made & judged her\nselfe unworthy of eternall life, following dumbe Idolls as she was led) and\njoyned unto a false church: that the Apostles words might be verified they\nwent out from us for they were not of us, if they had beene of us, they would\nno doubt have continued with us still. So that Antichristians & Christs\nfollowers have no relation nor affinity to or with one another.\n\nBut you may object, it may be said to them as well as to carnall men living\nin this Church, I deny it, for they submitting themselves to the ordinances of\nGod (though perhaps church papists) are under the compass of a truc visible\n\nchurch (as farre as I yet see) when as the Papists are of a false church &c. so\nmuch for that.\nSecondly you blame me for saying you meddled with great ones which you\nhad best let alone &c. I protest unto you, I never said it. The words that I said\n(as neere as I can remember without either addition or detraction) were these:\nyou had discanted on some randome, concerning praying for Maudline,\nwhich if you have done, you know, whether they be great one or little ones, if\nyou have not then you may repute me a lying Christian (as well as envying\nChrist) but I know on what grounds I spake it.\n\nFor your third it is partly true & partly false. I then spake in the words of\nthe Apostle that you ought to live with your wife as a man of knowledge,\nwhich I thinke you cannot take distast at since it was the words of the Holy\nGhost, & for your propounding to me the reasons of your living asunder, I\ndesire it not. Thinke not (I pray) that I harbour curiosity so much in me, as to\nbe a meddler in other folkes matters, lest I come under the Apostles reproofe,\nonely I thinke it occasion of scandall for a professor & his wife to live at\nvariance. For the other part I disclaime it utterly & therefore cannot nor will\nnot Answer for that which I never said nor thought.\n\nFor the fourth also is partly true & partly false, for the first I said it if I\nwere to live in the house as Goody Kennard is I should not endure, but to\nreprove you plainly, which was all to my knowledge that I said, wherein I\nmeant plainly & simply as I wish any one would do to me when they see\namisse in me. But for the other that she should not suffer you to use her\nhouse, it is others slanders and not my words.\n\nFor your last I have nothing to do with it, neither did I know any word to\nthat effect was spoke till I questioned about it & neither were as you have set\nthem downe, but I wonder why you should burden me with it, seeing you\nknow I spoke it not except by your denying the negative, you would have\nothers prove the affirmative, which I know none meanes to doe.\n\nThis I hope will give you satisfaction for that I spake, without any further\ncontention, & whereas you reprove me for whispering behind your backe I\nmay justly retort it on your selfe; for I spake it to one of your sociable companions,\nbut you noised it abroad before divers as I had notice, before you\nknew the truth. Thus craving pardon for my boldness intreating you to make\na favourable construction of all my Errors. I commit you to your safest conduct\nof the surest conductor and so remaine\n\nSometime your loved Sometime\n\nyour loathed\n\nSa: Jeake",

In a word I desire your happiness, & in some respect I could even\nwish my selfe miserable to attaine my desire.

Yet I must conquer my selfe & spite of my longing\nheart to wish longer. Desiring onely this one thing that what good I am not\nable to intreat God for you, the Lord of his goodness may please freely & fully\nto give downe upon you all for ever, that so it may come to passe that in all\nrespects & estates what soever wherein you are or may be considered you may\nin every of them be truly blessed that as men you may be faithfull, as souldiers\ncouragious as Christians gracious, & as Saints glorious, more than these I\ncannot pray for & I do & will pray that you may never enjoy less from the\nhands of the living God, who giveth abundantly and upbraideth no man, who\nsincerely seeketh his face for any present or future favour. And so deare\nChristians and Brethren, my faithfull & affectionate heart bids you all farewell,\nyou are all beloved of me, & I must now leave you to the love of God,\nwhose power guard you from all evill, grace guide you unto all good, peace\nrule in your hearts & mercy compasse you about in all estates. As my loving\nfriends I leave you to him that is the helper of the friendlesse. As warriours I\nleave you to the Lord of Hosts who is the mighty God of battell, as Christians\nI leave you to Jesus Christ both your Lord and mine. He abide with you, his\ngrace abound in you, his Holy Spirit be your comforter on Earth, your conductor\nto heaven. And now the God of peace that brought againe from the\nDead the Lord Jesus Christ , that great Shephard of the sheepe through the\nblood of the everlasting covenant make you perfect in every good worke to do\nhis will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus\nChrist, to whom be glory for ever and ever\n\nSoe prayeth yours whilst his owne\n\nSamuel Jeake",

Your\nfaithfull fellow feeling with the poore oppressed Kingdome, hath hitherto\nbeene manifested in your appearing as a Saviour unto it & your unwearied\nundertaking for publique good both in former and later actings. You have\nwaded through the Kingdome in blood & carrying your life on the point of\nyour sword have (by the strength of God in you) woone that you weare, & in\nvalour beene victor.\nYet it is not unknowne to you that the Kingdome yet groanes (for liberty\nas Waiting for the manifestacon of the Sonnes of God ) for shall a Nation be\nborne at once? or in one day delivered from the monstrous Mola's or conceptions\nits wombe hath inclosed & hatched these many ages? our miseries were\nbreeding many generations agoe, we must turne over yeares & reignes ere we\nread their Original, yea runne & rowle beyond the Norman Conquest, &\nthere finde some seeds of our divisions sowne, some men's wills made laws,\nsome publique persons act to privat ends, & judgment inverted into gall &\nwormwood, this we know what it meanes by wofull experience our diseases\nare not of yesterday, they are more desperate than will admit of a tedious\ncure, & what more bitter! our physicians have beene of no value, our remedies\nhave beene our diseases, he that helped & they that were helpen have both\nfallen & perished together.\n\nBut though our freedome be too intricate for man to recuperate yet are we\nnot left either hopeless or helpless, our great Jehovah being engaged to effect it,\n& for that purpose impower such Actors as majesty from heaven dwells upon,\namongst the which your honour challenges the foremost place, the anointing\nupon you being evidenced by the power with & in you, under whom though but\nthe other day (in the Enemies account) wee were fallen & as dry bones, yet now\nare Risen & stand upright the tempestuous & thunder threatening cloudes that\ndarkened our Horizon being dispersed through the power of the most High\nover shaddowing you.

I\nhave not forgotten since I was promised letters full of kisses, and that often.\nPrithee my Deare if my love deserue any thing, let me know where thou art,\nhow thou dost, and when I may comfort my languishing and sorrowful heart\nwith hopes to see thee thou never wentest away from me so, but wouldest tell\nme some time of returne. For my part I take God to witness I am very restles,\ndiscontented and cannot tell by what means to injoy any thing of my selfe\nwithout thee. I know not and that grieves mee whether this will come to thy\nhand, if it doenot what shall I doe, oh that I might injoy thee one night instead\nof every nights dreames on thee. I confes I live a most wretched comfortless\nsolitary and indeed heartles life. Oh that my heart should have such a fresh\nspring of love, so lasting, and so coming after its deare Jewell & not decay!\nTruly it makes me astonished and amazed at my selfe. I could (but that\nexperience too sadly convincedth me) have believed it impossible love could\nafter so many sharp incourters, so many grand repulses, remaine unconquered\nimperfection of it first springing. But God knows I know not any\nthing thou canst doe to me, or against me, can subdue it. It hath been used\ntoo barbarously and heathenishly, yet it is not offended, & that addeth to my\nmisery. My love me thinks tis too unnaturall to render contempt for love,\nslighting for a deare affection. Thou know it how boundless my love hath\nbeen, how unfeigned I need not here rehearse, and how durable the weariness\nof my many & great repulses too much to testify. Is there noe reward for\nvertue? Is there no jewell transparent but gold? Ah my Dear Heart consider\nhow many have been ruined by breaking their engaged faith & promise there\nis a time for every thing and certainly if thou wast afraid of God's Judgements\nin poor Mr Harding's case I know not how it can be otherwise, may I believe\ntis much worse in mine: for I suppose he might in proces of time have married\nanother, I must not. Thou wouldst be accounted iust in thy dealing, I pray\nGod give thee a heart to be so to me but yet I believe never poor lover had\nmore iniury and harder dealing than I have. Good my Dear Heart think upon\nme, and consider what I suffer for thy sake, poise the burden that lies on my\nheart but in thy thoughts, make but my case thine a little & weigh it in equity\nand doe not let all my life be spent in sorrows, and all comforts taken from me\natt all my Daies. I would I could but send thee one of my present bitter\ngroanes or that thou mightest but for the twinkling of an eye feel my aking\nheart, surely thy closed nature could not but relent and a little dissolve from\nits frozen hardnes. The God of Heaven mollify thy hard hart and make it\nmore naturall and not so stony to me. I know thou expectest mercy at Gods\nhands (which I pray God grant in the hour at death & day of Judgement) but\nhow canst though looke for any & exercise so much cruelty and falseness.\nIndeed if there were not another world it would not at all matter what our\nactions were, but my Love there will be atime of searching all the secrets of\nour hearts, no covers nor pretences can cloake us from the all seeing eye of\nGod. Didst thou ever read or canst thou believe faithless & merciles shall find\nmercy without repentance or amendment? Thous hast separated mee from\nthe society of men & from thy presence I must be excluded. What heart is able\nto beare and endure these, this hard measure and not complain? Or who can\nundergo so great a punishment. Where poor Mr Harding had one trouble I\nmust have 20. The God of heaven some way put an end to my wretchedness\nor my life or some way helpe me. I am not able to sustaine this cruelty. Poor\nI that want nothing can be laid to my charge, but that I am not borne toa\ngreat inheritance, that only abound in love and poverty, the last [word lost]\nthe former filthy and of noe beauty. A better fortune [may] make a lesser love\nfar more worthy in thy eyes, have a better lustere though never to good a\nrelish.

Wilt thou never assuage this scorching\nflame? Hast thou only added fewell to make a sacrifice? If it were ligated what\nmore comfortable? continually fed, what more cruell? Oh that I had any thing\nbut bitterness, teares, & a broken heart to send thee: I would I had the\ntreasures of the Indians to make access for my Petition or the fortune of ten\nthousand [words illegible] than I for my succes. But thou hast only loved mee\nto make me miserable, a byword\nand a spectacle which my misery too sadly\nproves, wert thou not mine by the comfort of thy fond dear Heart (how often\ngiven I shall not say) I would ingeniously acknowledge my importunity presumption\nand more then [word illegible] but what is freer then gifts? or what\ncan be more mine owne then what is freely given? Nay and if thou avert not\nthat inestimable Pearle farre above the worth of this faire world. I should not\naccount thee worth my seeking. but alas my dull pen cannot describe thy\nDeare value that my forlorne and dying heart hath put upon thee. If I had\nonly Complements to devise my fancy might be undervalued by its invention\nbut I have nothing but faithlessnes & broken promises to breake my broken\nheart. Oh that it might be broken at once for all, that I might once put an end\nto my grevious & just complaint! Could I have found any meanes to quench\nthis burning flame, I would not send to thee who wilt rather suffer my to dye\nfor thirst then give a drop of water to coole my scorched heart. If thou\nenduredst such a captivity so cruel a prison, so bad companions, and with all\nsoe continually inbittered with most exquisite Torment thou wouldst thinke it\nwere more then barbarous, more cruel then heathenish, more savage then\nbestiall. but I, poor I, have lost my Reason, the guide of my life, my liberty,\nthe inioyment of my selfe, my hopes, the comfort of my beeing, what have\nthen I left but a life not worth the name. I am sure death is a thousand times\nmore acceptable to mee then anything I enioy.\n\nIf others covet thee, thou art pleased to say thou wilt not forget what is\nbetwixt thy selfe & me, alas, if thou deny them, am I any better than they?\nAnd have not they as much as I nay more they are at liberty, so am not I, they\nmay make a new choice, so cannot I, they may have many, I must not have\none, mine owne. Surely thy thoughts are very bad of mee and thy love very\nsmall to mee to say I may make a new choyce when thou knowest I am bound\nunder an eternall course to marry none but thy deare selfe. It is not a wife, nor\na woman that I so much dote upon a tis none but thee who to me art the\nquintessence of all thy sexe, who though thou art so cruell wouldst give my\nsoule to Hell, God I hope will have more mercy for it.

I satisfied it and it had satisfied mee had it been the same as I have\nbeen, had it been true as I have been to the swearing away of my life, my\nmisery will never redound to thy honour, nor the breach of thy promises\nmake thee happy. For I beseech thee consider thy dealing with me, than\nknowest none hath above one heart (but thy selfe) how long thou hast had 2\nthou art not ignorant, doe but tell me then with what I shall love another\nwoman? Besides have I had so good success that if I were at liberty I could\nhope to be more fortunate. God blesse me till then and not longer. But alas\nmy Dear Heart tis nothing for thee to bid one leaden to run that cannot go. I\nam sure thou wast pleased in thy deare arms to call me husband, before I\ndurst dare to honour my selfe with the name of wife. But I perceive thy [word\nillegible] is apart of thy selfe subject to forget what it loves not, & very to\ncontinue in the contrary. I visit thy Dear Bab last Saturday that I might kisse\nmine owne. Why dost thou tell me thou canst not satisfy my Love God hath\nmade thee willing, there wants nothing but performance. Thou toldst me\nthou marriedst twice against thy will why not a third time to thy poor friend?\nSee if thou canst perswade thy hard heart a little to relent and with mee I beg\nof as for my life a faster hand since (my heart) thou thinkst I deserve thee for\nmy love before the God of Heaven conscious of my love & thy promises I beg,\nbeg & beseech thee let me be once rewarded with that treasure which I am\ndevoted to serve and honour to the breathing out of my last gasps, which if\nthis may not be I pray the God of Heaven put an end to my long lingering\nsorrowes & give thee peace and forgive thy hard dealing to\n\nThy Poor distressed but ever\n\nLoyall servant\n\nRichard Hartshorne\n\nThese for my dear but unkind Mrs Barbara Harding",

Such thoughts had never entered into my mind, nor (by God's grace)\nwill they enter. I have heard no word of the plague since the arrival of Thomas\nShoosmith. I have seen a bill of mortality in which none died of the plague.\nAlthough the bill does not engender much faith, I heard from D. Martin\n(with Thomas Shoosmith present) that two had died. Today I asked uncle; he\ndid not swear that a boy died in this parish when Thomas Shoosmith was\naccompanying me. After this I have heard nothing. Aunt is waiting for Mary\nKey, who has now recovered. Uncle also greets you. My cousin is well. I\nbought Buxton's Treasury of Volsius' Rhetoric concerning the size of the kernel\nof Amosius, 559 pages, and John Bulwer's Pathomyatomia, a small octavo, 240\npages, and 6s. 6d. I set out for D.

I have received\n\u00a310 from Mr Boucker; I have seen M. W. Stedd at whose instruction I have\nreleased \u00a310 to his servant, [and] introduced the receiver of his letter. I saw\nMr Allin. Friendly greetings to T. Shoosmith, with [his] mother etc.\n\nLask your prayers as well for my soul as for my body; I remain desirous of\nhearing of your safety; I have written very hurriedly.\n\nYour most obedient son\n\nSamuel Jeake junior",

And we should be content to advance to 14 your bushel\nif the cargo might be made up at different prizes not exceeding that. If you\nhave any prospect of accomplishment it will be requisite to be very diligent &\nspeedy & yet to do it without clamour, if you could make a beginning & buy\nsome indiff[erent] parcells of the principal farms we hope the rest might\ncomply & not advance much. We cannot allow more time for the buying &\nshipping it then a month after the receipt of this Letter. So if you can effect it\nas above you must not lose any time but fall to buying immediately with what\nprivacy you can, And for moneys draw on Mr Walter Monkeat at the Goate\nin Lothbury London. Your bills shall be well paid, And if you fraight a vessell\nmust agree with the master to stay 14 days at Rye & if you can get him under\n2s per quarter Winch[ester] but for a small matter we must not stand. We\ndesire your answer per first & if you proceed then every post or two as the\nbusiness goes forward.

But if he bea\nsubstantiall man & no danger of his breaking or Running away, I think it\n[words struck out] might be as well to bring your action against him for non\nPayment of the Bill, & not before or to make an attachment, then if you can\nas well have opportunity then to doe it. In this I think you will find a particular\nanswere to all your Queries, and it is the best advise I can at present give\nyou, & if I can doe you any further service therein, you may freely command\nme who am\nYour assured loveing friend & servant\nThomas Morris\nMy Cordiall Respects to your Father.\n\nTo Mr Samuel Jeake Junior Merchant in Rye",

Before your letter\nI heard this weeke by Mr Skeets that widow Girdler was dead but the bond\nyou mention she left not with me, when Mr Shamel and Mr Gibbons was with\nher at the house she had the bond there but carried it away with her againe.\nThey desired her she would leave it with some body that in case she should\ndye might deliver the bond in which she promised she would but into whose\nhands she intended then to put it she mentioned not, nor when she was last\nwith me at Rye did I see it. I had no more of hers to dispose of then the \u00a36\nwhich was lent Mr Padiham and the Bill for the same lay in her bag with the\n{words struck out] Paper wherein I had set down what I had paid her &\nreceived for her. When you write to Mr Curteis remember my love to him. I\nam sorry for your loss of Mr Tho: Crouch who I doubt not but hath gained\nby his death, being gone where the wicked cease from troubling & the weary\nbe at rest. I pitty his poore cosins of whom he took care, the Lord provide for\nthem. I thinke no man can put downe any house to lay another open but he\nmust make up the breach or else an Action of the case lies against him at the\nsuite of the Owner of the house so dammified. As to the monies you have put\nout or remaining by you I shall as yet draw none from you till I see more.\nThings are bad enough yet.

Your Mother remembers to you & your wife & desired\nme to write you that Capt Eve hath failed to see her or give her other security\nhere so she would have you write to him by some body that goes to Adlington\nCourt next weeke, and to tell your wife that the things she wrote to her in the\nletter she this day received she cannot buy, it coming but now to her hands &\nshe intending to come away Monday morning next by the Tunbridge coach.\nDr Stacey last time I saw him ordered me when I wrote to you to remember\nhim to you [words struck out].

If I had escaped hanging it would in all things have cost you\nbetween \u00a350 or 60 thou you proposed to comply and compound that would\nhave cost you \u00a3100 or more with charges and now for one quarter of the\nmoney that it would have cost you for my Pardon I can in all probability save\nmy life by going beyond sea and for you to strike out and [word illegible] me\nthat seems to not that you never designed my good or preservation because\nthe sum is so much less than what you said you would give for my Pardon\nwhich I must needs [word illegible] if I should be taken but I hope to save that\nfor I very much doubt and have a great deal of reason to believe that I should\nhave no Pardon since my life is not worth \u00a350 there hath beene a horse lost\nthat there hath beene more proferred to find him than you are now willing to\ngive for my life. Suppose that I were taken to night as God knows whether I\nshall or no I have little reason to beleive that if I should have a Pardon if \u00a350\nwould buy it but I dare be positive that \u00a3500 would not, for you proferred to\ngo as farr as \u00a3200 but I do am forced to believe you did but flatter me because\nin the first place you proffered it in the next place that when you saw it might\nbe had you would not performe it all this treates jelousy in me to thinke you\nnever designed to save my life and now in a manner convinces me that you\nhad rather I should be hanged than not. People that were absolutely strangers\nto me that might have \u00a3100 rather than faile \u00a3200 and want bread besides\nwhere I lye will not betray my life but would rather go to Goale, severall that\nhave [words struck out] beene brought upon their Oathes (who are strangers\nto me) to know where I were or whether they did not bring Tooles to bring me\nout though they really did it and had a reward put in their hands of 30 guineas\nto discover me refused both and also did their soules so much injury as to\nsweare falsely. I have no freind in the whole world now I see plainely what I\nnever mistrusted nor would have believed if 10000 men had sworn that you\nhad lay downe \u00a350 for my life but this looks very suspitious. Perhapps you\nmay do do as you do with the Imagination that I have other friends that will\ndo any thing for me but believe me I speake it from my soul and desire never\nto escape this trouble I am in if I know any one in this world that will give me\n\u00a320 to save my life sure [you] cannot thinke that if I had so much money as I\ndo here desire which is but \u00a340 in all that I would be so greate a sott and seeke\nmy owne Ruine so apparently as to stay in England in so much visible danger\nof my life which is as sweete to me as yours is to loose you if you this kepe.\nPray put the money into any bodies hands you can trust and let them not give\nme a penny till I am aboard and going off, if I should go to France as I am\nwithout money friend acquaintance or Creditt I must be forced to steale and\nthere I should be starved in Gaole and hanged at last, Mr Bulger whose father\nspent more than \u00a31000 to get him a pardon and ruined him selfe to do that is\ncome to see his son and had but \u00a312 in all the world hath given it him and his\nfriends & acquaintances have raised him \u00a3100 as I am told though they never\nexpect it againe and all this for to save his life they will do and more if neede\nrequired it & since in all probability this will be the last that I shall desire of\nyou I pray to God to open your heart this case and never no more do I do find\nit to be so hard to me as to provide what I have of thus heartily begged of a\nMother whom no body would believe but that the naturall tie of affection\nshould stirr you up to this most charitable deed towards me who am\n\nDeare Mother\n\nYour poore distressed yet dutifull son\n\nRich.

    "TEXT": "Samuel Starkey to Secretary Jenkins.\n\nI presume you have had an account of the trial at the Old Bailey on Lord\nPaget's indictment of trespass against Mr. Hartshorn and myself whereon we\nwere each fined 100/., Lord Sunderland's warrants (though they both expressly\nauthorized us to search all suspected places) not being approved authentic to\nsearch his house, being a peer, but no law or precedent was suggested to or by\nthe court to prove its illegality, and counsel are since of opinion that the verdict\nand judgment was misled by mistake or error and that our defence was\nnot duly argued for want of counsel, that the same ought to be reversed by\nappeal to the King and Council, and that the statute that says a peer's house\nshall not be searched without the Lord Lieutenant or Deputy Lieutenant,\netc., for arms does not affect our case nor exempt any house or place from\nbeing searched for traitors especially in so hot and close a pursuit as we then\nwere in. But I refer this and all other matters to your more mature determination.\nAfter I had so eminently hazarded my life and fortune in accusing and\nactually apprehending Aaron Smith and Simon and Samuel Maypn, by virtue\nof your warrant and that of three Deputy Lieutenants to search for and seize\narms, etc., and by the assistance of several parties of militia horse assigned by\nthe Earl of Bridgwater, I made a strict search for above twenty days and\nnights together and seized a great quantity of concealed arms, etc., at Mr.\nWharton's and Mr. Hampden's and narrowly missed Goodenough and Ayliffe\nat Enfield and also at Sir Roger Hill's. After Lord Paget and Justice Newman\nhad trepanned me out of Whitehall and secured me without warrant or commitment\na day and night close prisoner and without warrant seized and\nperused some of my private papers, and after I was released by you and committed\nfour days to a messenger's custody and on an examination before a\nCabinet council, then and not till then Lord Paget and Sir Roger, to stiffle my\ntestimony, pretended I had robbed them in searching their houses, whereon I\nwas recommitted to the Gatehouse to be prosecuted, but I was confined above\nfive months and neither prosecuted, tried, bailed or discharged though I\nthrice tendered 10.000/. bail. At last Lord Paget shrank his pretensions to an\nindictment of trespass only and suffered that too to sleep for four sessions, so\nthat at last I was forced to impanel a jury at my own charge and give notice of\ntrial at Hicks' Hall, but then to deprive me of the defence I had there made\nready of witnesses and counsel he removed the cause and without notice tried\nit by surprise at the Old Bailey.\n\nSir Roger resolves to prosecute me at the next Aylesbury assizes, 3 March. The\nguards assigned to assist us in our said search of Lord Paget's and Sir Roger's\nhouse are a party of Sir Francis Compton's troop and are our only witnesses.\nMy life and reputation lie at stake and can be preserved only by their testimony\nat the trial. Being a young man and rendered defenceless through a long\nimprisonment, I am altogether incapable of taking such effectual measures as\nmy case requires. Since I have fallen under these unhappy circumstances and\nthrough my said services have created many inveterate animosities amongst\nthe factious party, and Lord Paget and Sir Roger and others through their\ninstigation have made great stickling to stiffle my evidence and irritate his\nMajesty and Council and yourself against me, I hope you will not prejudge my\ncause but consider there is always a malignant party always ready to stigmatize\nthose that are most loyal and indefatigable to serve his Majesty. Therefore I\npray your favourable assistance that the said party of the Guards may be\nspecially ordered to attend and give their testimony on my behalf at my trial at\nAylesbury and that all my said warrants and papers may be forthwith\nredelivered me or secured in some safe hands ready to produce at my trial.",

Tis I believe now certain, this coming by express from Holland, with\nthis account that the peace was signed last Friday night by the Plenipotentiarys\nof England, Holland, Spain & France with liberty for the Emperor to sign in\nsuch a time and Strasburgh to be restored to the Empire or the Equivalent\nwhich of the Two the Emperor chuses. The King is now expected over in a\nvery short time. And things will look with a good face again.

Tomo[rrow] we have a Court at the Bank where I hope we shall\nbe ordered our Bonds in & to receive our dividend. Pray don't trouble me\nwith any errands, I pray tell Mr Tucker I was in Southwark to day, but could\nhear no news from Sturbridge Fair. Mr Travell told me hops had some stur on\nthem, at least would not go currant at above \u00a310 or \u00a310 5s there I think it not\nprudence to run much above 9 in the Country, for now there is a peace there\nwill be a noise made of the importing of forrain hops. I wrote you last I did\nnot care to go above \u00a3150 deep in that commodity. As to flax seed buy what\nyou can, but do not exceed what I ordered for now forrain flaxseed will be\nimported. Tell Mr Tucker I would willingly have a letter from him [and] know\nwhat he has done about hops, or what he is like to do.

But as\nfor Apps's, if it be so bad as you write it is no matter whether he come again\nor no. However what you have bid him I would have you stand to. You had\nbest keep their samples for sometimes they are apt to bring samples better\nthan their goods are. I doubt not but you will buy all you can & get them to\nbring it in assoon as they can. & keep the white by it self & the brown by it\nself. I could not hear how hops were at Sturbridge fair last post & I have not\ntime to go into Southwark now. I wrote you last post what I heard that hops\nwere then at a stur, but how it is now I know not. But I depend that Mr Tucker\nwill have advice from Southwark by the man he said he write to for that purpose.\nI refer you to my last letter about hops. I still think it's not worthwhile\nto give above 9 in the country. I do not hear anything since of my Chapman\nabout the Tickets, But now there is peace I doubt not but we shall be paid in\ntime. I went to Mr Offley this week & he promised me to speak for Br Holman\nto some of the Commissioners that he knows, of which have given her account\nby post. For me to go to Mr Strong &c. whom I know not will signify not a\nfarthing. I am glad to hear so many new freeman made &c. There's no need\nof certificates yet about the Annuities. Yesterday I was at the Bank Court,\nwhere the Governour told us we should have our Bonds del[ivered] up when\nwe would, & should have warrants [word lost] our overplus viz. 3 2 p Cent. at\nMichaelmas. You may tell Mr Manooch I will take care to receive his when I\nreceive mine. I suppose it will be paid by Michaelmas. Bank is now at 95.\nThat's usual for it to waver here every day.

    "TEXT": "London Sept. 21\" 1697\nMy Dear\nI have yours of the 18'\" & like well what you do about flaxseed, only am\ntroubled that I cannot ease you of that trouble by my presence but there is no\nhelp for it at present for I think it necessary for me to stay some time longer\nhere. I would have you imploy Goddin when you want any help about the\nflaxseed, and of all you buy get it in assoon as you can, for when there is a\nquantity of 30 or 40 quarters I intend to have it to London. As for money if\nmy mother be willing to let you have \u00a330 I will pay interest for that which with\nwhat you have will do for the present & \u00a310 I suppose Mr Curtis will bring\nsoon after Michaelmas. But if you find you shall want more let me know a\nweek before you think you shall need it & I can have it here, for Mr Miller\nbeing to have % will pay his part here, & I shall take care to remitt it you. I\nwould have you send to Colman the Tailor & tell him before my Mother (who\nmay be a witness) that if he intend to stay in my house I shall not let it under\n50s per year. Only because he may be unprovided I will condescend that he\nmay tarry till Ladyday at the rate of 40s per annum. And know his mind one\nway or other before Michaelmas day. Then after you have done this send to\nMr John Curteis junior or his wife & give them warning either to continue in\nmy house at \u00a34 per annum or else to leave it at Ladyday, be sure give warning\nbefore Michaelmas. I shall never get any rent of them & therefore I must take\nthis occasion & now there is peace I do not fear a Ten{an]t. If Colman refuse\ntocontinue as above then you may tell Mrs Curtis if she will remove thither\nat 50s per year, she may which I will admit of because she was your midwife,\nfor I shall be always troubled to get the Rent. But that keep to your self. If\nColfman] leave his house its like he will go back into his own & [word lost]\nperhaps Smith may hire or buy mine, which my Mother m[ay] mention to\nthem if it should so fall out. Bank stock continues at 95 1/2. I wrote you\nbefore I had received my Bank Note of \u00a327 16s 9d. And I have received \u00a341\n7s 5d on my Bank seal'd bill & tomorrow I am like to receive \u00a330 more & this\nweek or next [ shall have my dividend of 3 % per % which is \u00a331 10s and my\nBonds in. If John Dickson enquire about his Bond tell him I have received\n\u00a325 of it & am prom[ised] the rest on Saturday & hope it will be then paid.\nWhen it is I will write word. I thank God for preserving our house from fire\n& for all his special Providence.\nThe Peace I hope will prove very advantagious to us. I would fain stay a little\nlonger in hope the Bank will rise higher & though it costs me something more\nhere in expenses & diet it must do if I continue here then it would do at home,\nyet I hope your saving there will make some compensation for it. I do think it\nmay be worth my while to stay a month longer & to see how things will be\nwhen the king comes over, which I believe will give the stock another rise. I\ncannot sell our tickets at 17 therefore I mean to keep them, for I think they\nwill be paid next year. If you can spare so much time hear Betty to construe\nsome Latine & to say over the declensions & conjugations, else I shall have all\nto begin again at my Return. Give my duty to my mother, my love to you &\nthe Children & Bab. I have sent the letter to her Mother*' & seen her, & she\nwill send a Cap before long. Give my service to Mr Maior, Mr Tucker, Mr\nMannooch & other friends. If I have no business I shall write but once a\nweek, therefore be not troubled when you have no letter, for if I should be ill\nyou may depend on it I will not fail to write. But I have my health very well I\nbless God for it. Tell Mr Tucker that I have been in Southwark this afternoon\nto enquire about Hops. & now they tell me that Hops were run down at\nSturbridge fair before it was done to \u00a38 10s per hundred though I understand\nit was because the weather was very wet & dirty & they sold so rather than\ncarry them back to London, some say there is a good crop in Flanders &\nmany are expected from thence. There lyes our greatest danger in bringing\nover Flemish hops. The market in Southwark is dull from \u00a39 10s to \u00a39 15s or\n\u00a310. But tomorrow is the great market day for hops there & Mr Travel has\npromised me to send me by penny post how they go there & I will not fail to\ngive him further advice by next post. But I believe it will be a dull market. For\nthe weather being so very wet they will come up in a dirty condition & being\ndull already are not like to quicken this week. In the mean time I think it best\nto forbear buying any more till he hears further. And as for those already\nbought I am clear of opinion to send them up assoon as possible, for after this\ndulness it's very like they may quicken again in October & then we shall be\nready for the market before forrain hops can possibly come in. Besides the\nprice being considerable it will be best to make our returns assoon as we can.\nMr Miller & wife &c remembers to you, to my mother & Betty, as also to\nMr Tuckers.

    "TEXT": "London Oct 21\" 1697\nMy Dear\nI am much troubled to hear by yours of the 19\" that you are so ill & indisposed\n& also that my little Girl is ill. I will not give you so much trouble as to\nsend the flaxseed but tell Morrow I shall not send it till after Christmas which\nas it will free you from that fatigue which I would not by any means should\nfall upon you; so we think also it will come to a better market toward spring\nthan now. Truly I am much concerned for your trouble but I hope this will be\nsome ease to your mind that I shall be home before it will need to be sent. I\nwrote you last post not to give above 32s for any brown, nor above 20s for\nwhite per quarter. & to let Goddin turn it. I thought I had wrote you every\nweek if not I forgot my self. But if Mr Tucker did not tell you about Guineas\nit was his fault for I desired him particularly to acquaint you & I thought he\nmight have done so much. To day in the Gazett is an advertisement that they\n[guineas] shall be taken for Custom & Excise &c at 22s. so that I am apt to\nthink they may pass a while & many do take them so here for goods I believe\nno body refuses them. I will take care about your Petticoat & Combs. I do\nthink as I wrote before to return in mid: Novembfer]. I would fain see whether\nwe shall have a dividend first. To morrow we have a General Court at the\nBank & I find most of the Members are for it, so that I hope there will be an\norder for one & when I have seen what Influence it has on the stock that if it\ntise I may sell some, and withall have waited a little to see whether hops will\nmend I shall think of returning. There's no money on the Million Lottery.\nSeveral of the Proprietors are to meet next Wednesday to concert the best\nmethods to obtain the Arrears where I intend to be with them. I suppose it\nwill be to petition the Parliament about it assoon as they sit, before they fall\non other business. Trouble not your self about the Poor Tax, thats all the\nmischief they can do.

You have done very well about Snoads flaxseed.\nNevertheless if he should bring it in & insist upon your agreement I would\nhave no difference with him but would give him 34s p quarter if he be so satisfied.\nFor I would have every body easy that I deal with: Or if you find him\nmuch dissatisfied (as you know at the return of your messenger) I had rather\ngive 36s then have any brawling about it. And so you may send him word if\nyou find it convenient. For it's a pretty great quantity & if it be very good I am\nwilling to have it, for I find there will not be much more to be had. If he have\nbrought it in before you receive this then it must be adjusted when I return.\nBut as for any other parcells I say as before give not above 32s per q[uarter].\nNor above 20s for white. I wrote to Mr Tucker to furnish you with \u00a330 & that\nIwould pay so much the more here towards the hops. But if he cannot or be\nnot free then you must put away some Guineas for my mother at 22s as they\ngo currant for Goods. Or you may draw \u00a330 on me. Only if you draw on me\nlet me know when you write again which way you intend to make use of that\nmy money may be ready. I hope you are better in health & am glad to hear my\nlittle girl is mending. Madam Thompson says bole Armoniack & white\nsugar candy powdered & blown through a quill into her mouth is good if it be\nof the nature of the Thrush. I wrote you last post that I will not send the\nflaxseed till after Xmass. So you will not be troubled with shipping it.

I had a letter from Mr Tournay\nthat he will be at Rye to morrow and pay the money there; The Butter is come\nby Tho: Morrow. Madam Miller says that Trains are worn still with womens\nupper petticoats but not so long as formerly; And as for fringes she saith they\nwear them strait but she would not advise you to alter any for they are worn\nboth ways, Twas a good time to have bought in the Bank yesterday for it fell\nfrom 105 to 104 upon a blind story of the Frenches coming. But that being\nblown over it rose again today to 104'. As for telling when 'tis a good time to\npurchase that's past my skill or any body's else. I have taken up sixty five\npounds of Mr Newman of Winchelsea for which I gave him a note payable\nthe 26\" of May before which time I hope to be at home. Madam Miller desires\nto know whether the silk you would have drawn with Indian sprigs be for a\nMantua or for a Lining, for she saith if it be for a Mantua it will be so very\ntedious for you to work it that she would rather advise you to have it painted\nwith lively flowers which shews exceeding well & may be done for about 15s &\nwill wear very well provided it don't come to wet which you will have no\noccasion to use it in. So she would have you send word next post. I cannot yet\nmeet with any iron kettles that hold above 8 gallons or 10 at most. So have not\nbought yet. I have received one & Twenty pounds & nineteen shillings of Tho:\nMorrow for which I being absent Mr Miller hath drawn a bill upon you this\nday by my order paiable at sight to one Mr John Atkins or order, which I\ndesire you to pay when bought to you. I think he is a Lydd* man but that is\nnot material. Take a Receit on the bill when you pay it, If he come not himself\nthen see if his name be endorsed on the bill or else do not pay it. I have spoke\nto Mr Ferris & he saith he will write to Robt Brown to let you have 2 Retum\nthe first he can. So I would have you get \u00a3100 mre of him unless you can\nmeet with it or part of it before he can let you have it, you may take up money\nof my mother till I come home.

I pray God continue it & restore your\nhealth & to him return thanks and in all your ways acknowledge him & he\nshall direct your pathes. I suppose the pain of your head may return again,\nbut if it do be not out of heart: as it returns so it may remove. Man is born to\ntrouble. Endeavor to make a sanctified use of all afflictions, & let all the dispensations\nof providence draw you nearer to God & more off from the world\nin which you are but a stranger as the Apostle speaks of the believer in the\n11\" of the Hebrews who did not take up their rest in this world but looked for\na City that hath foundations whose builder & maker is God. Look upon sin\nas the greatest Evil of all & pray to God not to lead you into Temptation.\nAvoid all occasions of sin, lest you be left to your own strength & fall, Keep\nin the way of God's providence & in doing your duty & then you may expect\nhis protection. Chuse affliction always rather than iniquity. These directions\nthat I give you will be of use to you in after times as well as now even thro the\nwhole course of your Life. It is a comfort to me that I have observed in you\nsome good thing towards the Lord God of Israel & I trust he will perfect that\ngood work he has begun in your conversion to him to serve the living God. If\nyou acquaint your self with Christ it is not so much matter for acquaintance\nin the world. I commit you to God & remain\nYour affectionate father\nSa: Jeake\n\nTo Elizabeth Jeake at Madam Brewers at Fowlers in Hawkhurst in Kent",
